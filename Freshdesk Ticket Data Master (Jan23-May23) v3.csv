Thanks for reaching out.
We configured the bot and told the team to onboard themselves
independently. Not sure if everyone understands how to best use it, and
what options are available.
I am thinking about scheduling a tutorial for my team - any advice and tips
on what to address?

Best,
Yonat

We are looking for a simple clock in / clock out app, and currently we are on the nonprofit free plan with slack. Do you guys have more favorable pricing for nonprofits? We have a very large org (50-60), so the per-user pricing would be a non-starter for us unfortunately.

Can you please tell me what sort of permissions are required to add Attandance Bot to Microsoft Teams. We are looking for temperory solution for small group of people. Later it might be deployed to everyone in  our organization. I am trying to set up but it gets stuck on the permissions issue. I need to know what Microsoft Graph API permissions it needs.,"shall I send him article on how to install ab in teams? not sure why the app is named""meeting attendancebot"" in screenshot. ",1/26/2023
"

there seems to be an issue with commands ""wfo/ho every Monday"", ""wfo/ho every Tuesday"" etc.

Even though I receive the confirmation of it, it does not pop up in the calendar view. However, it also seems that it does not record it at all, because a notification is send to employees after that, that they have not scheduled the necessary WFO days. It applies to several employees as far as I know, me, Neda, Ben etc.

Would you please have a look at it?

Thanks a lot

"I've moved some leave types to be inactive and created a new one to match our new PTO policy. Still, I cannot add the keyboards (such as vacation) because they are already assigned to a previous policy, even tho I've removed them from the old policies. ","Happy to help. It sounds like you found the keyword editor, which is located at the top when you open a leave type for editing. If you've already removed keywords (like vacation) then my guess is that the name itself for inactivated leave types is causing the issue - leave type name is the primary keyword, so if you have a ""vacation"" leave type - even deactivated - you will no longer be able to use ""vacation"" elsewhere. I'd recommend deleting altogether OR just repurposing since you can rename and leave type. If you'd like assistance, all I need is the name of your Slack or Microsoft Teams workspace, along with a little additional context, and I can make the changes for you :) Let me know!

I am interested in using this app. My manager is a team of 4 including herself. Since she has no time to learn this app she has asked me to set it up for her. Is there a video or documentation tutorial (walk through) on how to setup AttendanceBot as a Manager and also one for her direct reports. I will be training my team and helping to set this up on the 10th of February. Can we setup sometime to go through this or if you can email be documentation or links to videos so I can be prepared to train my team.

We will only use this for PTO and not for projects.

Thank you,

Subject: 4 quick tips to get more out of AttendanceBot


EXTERNAL - Use Caution. Do not click links or open attachments unless you know the content is safe.

Hi Harlan,

While you continue to explore possibilities with AttendanceBot, I thought you'd appreciate 4 quick tips to help hasten your discovery.
1. Get some teammates involved - AttendanceBot is truly a team tool, so its magic takes root with scale. Chat ‘introduce’ to the bot to start building your pilot team.
2. Browse command options - message 'cheat sheet' to bring up a list of common commands. As an admin, you can even tailor this document to your team!
3. Customize your experience - Have you explored the settings panel yet? From reminders and permissions to custom leaves and approval workflow to project and client tracking, you can customize pretty much everything. Just message ‘settings’ to get behind the scenes.
4. Announcements - Add @attendancebot to a team to stay in the loop with who's clocked in, who's on break, who has upcoming time off, who has a birthday, or your own custom reminders.

There is - of course - plenty more to consider like permissions, smart reminders, and calendar or payroll integration, but these tips should be enough to warm up the engines.

As always, I'm here for any questions you have, or you can schedule a quick call<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc1MDk5MTI4LCJuYmYiOjE2NzUwOTkxMjgsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiJmN3k1aG43bTkwaXAxOG54YXN2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09dGlwcyZfX3M9b2traTU5cjNoeDQwdXlneTh2MW4ifQ.o9C4UYbtoFYKeiUMndUq_5qHj9hv-4U4JKk-si3NhTk__;!!A14RNwfIftzD!RZX_nGBP16lNV-AO44HBWS4MRdJt3ofcMuO1nmjwZM1E0MQJNsQlF3iCwfy8hqSYmIKc3NhQUyKZvVdAXej_FZI$> to dive deeper on any of these topics.

Thomas F. Has reached out to me today that he would like to add the punches into the timesheet, but it does not load it.

He has also tried editing the time range, but that did not help.

The screenshot from him:

I have also tried, but even though I am choosing him, it still shows my times and not his:

We have an employee named Dhawal Tote (P0544), who is unable to apply casual leave for 1st Feb 2023, through AB.

While he is trying to apply, AttendanceBot is giving him an error message as "" You are trying to apply leaves for days which are all holidays/weekend. Please change your dates and try again."" (Screenshot attached)

We did check for our Holiday Calendar 2023 for India Client Operation team and confirm that there is no holiday on 1st Feb 2023, and it also is not a weekend.

Could you please check at your end and confirm of the problem and ways to rectify it?

We have recognized a very slow loading time in general, but sometime it is even worse.

It takes a lots of time to load stuff on the web app, and I would like to ask if it has something to do with browser, country or anything.

Is there a way on how to improve it?

I have captured a gif for you to see how long it takes.

Thank you for checking it.

"This is a follow up from ticket 17790. It appears to relate to the original issue (duplicate status), along with the limitation on ""breaking a status"" (which was initially implemented as a fix to the duplicate issue. Over the past month, we have a handful of instances of duplicate status for the same user/time: shiyun.lum@century21.ca - Feb 1 - user set full day wfh and then changed to half day sick (see attached screenshot of chat with bot)
 tbartram@uniglobe.com - Jan 11 -user set full day wfh and then changed to half day sick
 These 2 both appear to be issues with half day leave not being able to break/overwrite a full day status. Note that I have tested this and it is not specific to status type (wfo, wfh, sick). It is specific to half days breaking whole days. We also had: jerick.guevarra@century21.ca - Jan 27 - Status set by himself and another admin on the same day

 Please research these and apply the necessary updates so that duplicates do not occur. In the first 2, it should break the status and apply the prior status to the remaining half day (as works already for multi-day leaves).",​Thanks for raising this.

"When receiving notification to approve vacation leave, I get a message that says, Name of Employee current pre-approval balance for Vacation: 9.8041 other person is on leave during these days. We have one other person on leave that day. Is the 9.8041 a percentage of the entire staff off that day? Or is it something else? The person requesting vacation does not have any other vacation scheduled.

Hi again Richard,

How was your first week?

I see you have less than a week left on your trial and haven't tinkered much with AttendanceBot. If you're looking for more support, we're here to help! We can walk through the ropes of being an admin, assist in setting up your team, thinking through rollout, evaluating subscription options, or share best practices from our clients. Do you have time for a check-in<https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc1NDE4OTM4LCJuYmYiOjE2NzU0MTg5MzgsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiJ6YXloaXVobjEzeDFhd2RjN2xzayIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJl9fcz1hNnJsYmFzZnU0cDBzamhoZW02NyJ9.z0SjbmvVYtG_-b0mJLU8raIFzpsxXnsUNN3jWzC9CPo>?

","Sure! We would love to welcome you back and happy to restart your trial. Meanwhile, can you tell me for how many employees do you have? I am asking because AttendanceBot is free upto 5 users and if you have more employees, I can definitely chalk out a special pricing for you :) Have a happy weekend! Cheers ​Thea",2/3/2023

*I understand the role my actions played in this issue; however, I need
your help to correct the issue.* Additionally, I believe this issue points
out potential bugs in either or both of your systems. Please give close
attention to the full description of the issue and the impact.

Gusto referred me to this email (support@gusto.com) to report an issue with
an integration with Attendancebot. I am including Attendancebot support in
case there is a way on your end to troubleshoot.

I am unable to match to the correct user in Gusto for Rebecca Victor
because, erroneously, a new user was created when what needed to happen was
she needed to be ""re-hired"" in Gusto's system.

After finding out the error, I requested that the user Rebecca Victor's
duplicate account be deleted from Gusto because if that is done, then the
integration will again work.

I am again requesting that Rebecca's duplicate account in Gusto be deleted.

*Please read carefully*

I run payroll on a weekly basis and the ease of using this integration is a
benefit to me. Attendancebot returns an error when I try to submit payroll
via the Attendancebot to Gusto integration, due to the mismatched account
(see screenshot).

Request to Gusto: Please remove the account that does not have banking
account information for Rebecca Victor so that I may proceed with the
integration.

Request to Attendancebot: Please reset the matching for user Rebecca
Victor, to see if I will be able to then rematch/remap to the correct user
(there currently are two users by the same name Rebecca Victor) in Gusto.
I am making the Attendancebot request because I am not sure that Gusto will
remove the erroneous account for Rebecca though I placed two calls making
this request and despite this email request following up with Gusto (at
their direction).

*There is an urgency to this request*

Also, there is some time pressure because I have a deadline of Monday at
7pm to run payroll to have employee direct deposits made by Friday morning
of the same week.

I will check for responses between now and Monday. Please give this your
urgent attention. Please give me a phone call at any time at 212
586-0899.

","Here's the screenshot from Attendancebot:

You will see that it is trying to match to both users (one is active and
the other is inactive) - Rebecca Victor.

Attendancebot directs me to do what is not advisable.
Gusto doesn't register this as an issue on their end. They have not (so
far) offered me a viable long term solution. They believe both accounts
should remain reflected in their system. I wish that they would remove the
incorrect account as it was created in one day and reported the next day as
incorrect. No funds have flowed to that Gusto account. There is no SSN
nor any banking information attached to that account.

I wish for both service providers, Attendancebot and Gusto to make my work
easier by addressing what seems to be a bug in both systems. I need an
option to move forward with using this integration to make running payroll
a button push.

"  So we've just lost a team member today (Priscilla) and need to calculate her PTO hours owed and we're very confused.  We added 40hrs to everyone's balance as ""advanced"" hours to be deducted in July or when they leave the company.  Priscilla's balance at the moment is 42.16 hours (which would be 2.16 hours in reality). That does not seem right.  The total of her hours worked this year is 196.98, so 196.98 x 0.083 = 16.35 PTO hours accrued. She took one 8-hour day off on January 13th, so her owed hours should be 8.35 (not 2.16).  I compared her accrued hours and timesheet and found some discrepancies. She worked 8h18m on January 4th, so she should have accrued 41 minutes that day, but it says she accrued only 21. Same thing on January 5th - she should have accrued 39 minutes that day but only accrued 21.  Can you please let me know what is going on ASAP? Maybe we're missing something.  Thanks, Carol",I am getting it investigated by our engineering team.  Cheers Thea,2/7/2023

My colleague is having the same issue again. He can't sign in and out. He
went on a long vacation. Please fix the issue.

Kindly note that I might look for another service if this issue persists.
If you can remove the mandatory check out then that would be great.
Normally in the evening, we don't really monitor our people as they always
work late. They just want to shut their laptops and call it a night. We are
very happy with how things were in the previous versions. Now, what if I go
on leave for 2 weeks? I will have to face the same issue? We don't use the
leave functions here as we have other means of doing it.

Kindly advise when this is going to be resolved. Thank you.

It seems that there is an issue with WFO commands.

We have people coming into the office to Vienna from Salzburg a few times a month.

They reschedule their 'wfo every monday', 'wfo every tuesday' etc to HO, and request WFO again, so that they can choose the right office.

However, it seems that it does not always work, or does choose the office itself.

In addition, it in the PunchBoard shows only at the office they are initially assigned.

Thank you for contacting Gusto, my name is Kevin, I'm the agent assigned to your case.

I know how important is for you to have the correct information in your integrated app in order to process payroll correctly, I'm happy to assist you.

Rebecca's profile can't be deleted from the system, however you can perform a dismissal process in the incorrect profile and then perform the rehire process in the correct profile, by doing this you the incorrect profile is not going to be in the list of active employees, so AttendanceBot should recognize her profile.

Please let me know if you still may need help with this matter, I'd be happy to assist you!

Evening,

*I understand the role my actions played in this issue; however, I need your help to correct the issue.* Additionally, I believe this issue points out potential bugs in either or both of your systems. Please give close attention to the full description of the issue and the impact.
Gusto referred me to this email (support@gusto.com) to report an issue with an integration with Attendancebot. I am including Attendancebot support in case there is a way on your end to troubleshoot.
I am unable to match to the correct user in Gusto for Rebecca Victor because, erroneously, a new user was created when what needed to happen was she needed to be ""re-hired"" in Gusto's system.
After finding out the error, I requested that the user Rebecca Victor's duplicate account be deleted from Gusto because if that is done, then the integration will again work.
I am again requesting that Rebecca's duplicate account in Gusto be deleted.
*Please read carefully*
I run payroll on a weekly basis and the ease of using this integration is a benefit to me. Attendancebot returns an error when I try to submit payroll via the Attendancebot to Gusto integration, due to the mismatched account (see screenshot).
Request to Gusto: Please remove the account that does not have banking account information for Rebecca Victor so that I may proceed with the integration.
Request to Attendancebot: Please reset the matching for user Rebecca Victor, to see if I will be able to then rematch/remap to the correct user (there currently are two users by the same name Rebecca Victor) in Gusto. I am making the Attendancebot request because I am not sure that Gusto will remove the erroneous account for Rebecca though I placed two calls making this request and despite this email request following up with Gusto (at their direction).

*There is an urgency to this request*
Also, there is some time pressure because I have a deadline of Monday at 7pm to run payroll to have employee direct deposits made by Friday morning of the same week.
I will check for responses between now and Monday. Please give this your urgent attention. Please give me a phone call at any time at 212 586-0899.

Here's the screenshot from Attendancebot:
You will see that it is trying to match to both users (one is active and the other is inactive) - Rebecca Victor.
Attendancebot directs me to do what is not advisable.
Gusto doesn't register this as an issue on their end. They have not (so far) offered me a viable long term solution. They believe both accounts should remain reflected in their system. I wish that they would remove the incorrect account as it was created in one day and reported the next day as incorrect. No funds have flowed to that Gusto account. There is no SSN nor any banking information attached to that account.
I wish for both service providers, Attendancebot and Gusto to make my work easier by addressing what seems to be a bug in both systems. I need an option to move forward with using this integration to make running payroll a button push.

Sorry for the inconvenience with the AttendanceBot and the time it is taking to get resolved.

Since this is a 3rd party app, we don't have all the tolls to troubleshoot the issue, I am sending you the article with the steps to map your employees to AttendanceBot, if it is not working you will need to contact AttendanceBot support for further help, the AttendanceBot contact information is at the end of the article.

Integrate with AttendanceBot.

Please find attached the leave application error for 7th April 2023, for US employees.

It is not a holiday for US employees on that day.

Please can you check and update the calendar.

Also, For Rachel Dam, her annual leave count is incorrect. She is a new joinee and should only be getting the relevant number of annual leaves which is 20. Screenshot of the error attached.

Please check above issues and rectify at the earliest.

Can you explain what is going on and what we can do to properly credit her hours? I think might be able to add a Punch In/Punch Out combination, but only after she has worked all her hours. Which means we don't get the advantage of reminders or notices on Slack. Thank you for your attention!

I’m finding the Mailroom is very slow. When I take a picture of an item, it doesn’t allow me to assign it to someone until 2 hours later and once I select notify, it doesn’t actually notify that person until several hours later. Is this how it is supposed to function?

Additionally, I see that it is a paid service but I don’t see anywhere that states what the service actually costs. Are you able to tell me the cost of Mailroom?

We've not gotten this to be resolved yet with Attendancebot. Therefore, I
am not able to use the automation that allows me to submit payroll with one
click.

It appears, that the mapping of Rebecca Victor needs to be re-set. That
way I can manually re-map her account, if that is possible. As it stands,
Attendancebot is retaining a mapping to an account that no longer exists in
Gusto's system. Gusto believe it has resolved our issue on their end.

If after reviewing the information from Gusto and the screenshot below you
believe that the issue is not on your (Attendancebot's) end, meaning you
believe it is a user error (my misuse of your product), else on Gusto's
end, please make that abundantly clear. I will then correct the mapping --
or follow up with Gusto.

Please know that there is no option for me to re-map. I have waited for
this option but have not found it and no one from Attendancebot has replied
to our company's request that Attendancebot reset the mapping to allow me
to start from the beginning with Rebecca's account mapping.

At this time, I believe Gusto has resolved the issue on its end, but I am
not getting the attention on Attendancebot's end.

Please review the *entire* history of this matter before replying. You will
see emails from aaronf@tuffcity.com across the past 3 weeks.

","​I have forwarded your message for investigation. Please allow us sometime to troubleshoot! ​ Thanks, Thea",2/27/2023
"Hello AttendanceBot Support: Our Gryphons group has been retired. As such we would like to remove the group from AttendanceBot and from the ""This channel for next 7 days"" notification listings. Unfortunately I believe that will have to be done by AttendanceBot support as I'm getting errors when I try to remove the group and I don't want to break the ""This channel for next 7 days"" notification listings. Thank you! Jeremy Higgins  CRC Endpoint Services  Stanford | University IT  650.725.HELP(4357)  Request Support: http://services.stanford.edu","We have checked the backend and could't find the announcement for ""Gryphons"" slack channel. I can confirm that AttendanceBot has been removed from the channel so has the announcements associated with it.  Cheers Thea",2/27/2023
"

I am putting together my handover documents for our HR team to fully take over Attendencebot and I cannot find the contract we have.

Could you kindly send it to me.

Thanks
Claire Lockerbie

","I'm unable to locate any signed contract, but I was able to find this agreement document. Since we don't typically sign specific contracts, but rather rely on our legally binding terms of service and written email agreements, I can't be sure if a contract was never signed or if my old colleague Pranav simply failed to save and store a signed document. Do let me know your thoughts Thea",2/28/2023
"Can only admins sync to gusto?
Can syncing be done automatically?


	
	

","Only the admins have access to the integrations tab so they can sync their Gusto account with AttendanceBot. Here's an article explaining how can admins send hours to Gusto: https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000112898 Best, Thea",2/28/2023
"Our team is less that 5 people. Do we still need to subscribe?


	
	

","You can continue to use AttendanceBot for free. Once you cross the 5 user mark, you need to subscribe to our app.  Cheers Thea",2/28/2023
"when user forgot to punch out, later they can't edit/change their punch in/out times. You can look at our user Kaspars","We have rolled out a new feature wherein if the user forgets the punch out yesterday, they have to first enter the time and then can punch in for the new day. I have checked his logs and I can see that the app is expecting him to add a punch out time for 24th Feb. The message we are sending him is ""It appears you forgot to punch OUT on 24 Feb. Your last punch IN was on 24 Feb at 09:12 AM. Before you can punch in, please state your OUT time for 24 Feb (e.g 6 PM)"" ​ He needs to type punch out first by responding with the time and then only can he punch in today ​ Best, Thea",2/28/2023
