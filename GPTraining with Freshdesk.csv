AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi, I need to be able to set capacity limits by department as well as a capacity limit by the whole office.  Is it possible?


	
	

","Hi Franco,     Thanks for reaching out.     As it turns out, AttendanceBot supports capacity limits assigned only to office level but not department level. However, I can definitely understand why this would be handy, though! I will pass it on to the product team and add your vote to this one.     If you want to set up limits on office capacity, here's a help article for your reference:  https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000117213   ​   Hope this was helpful!

","Hi Trish,     Thanks for reaching out.     In such cases, we suggest you to delete the leaves for Josh (from 26th Dec to 4th Jan) which is reflecting as 7 days currently and then to balance out, you could manually add 1 day of leave in his leave balance.      For manually adjusting the balance, you could head to dashboard-->Vacation management-->Leaves-->Leave balances and click on Josh's profile. Now select the leave type you would like to edit the balance for, head to ""Adjustment tab"" and complete the manual adjustment & hit save.      I have attached a few screenshots for your reference as well. Please give this a try and let me know if it works for you :)   Cheers,  Moira   ",1/5/2022

","Hi Zainab,     Thanks for reaching out.     You subscribed to the AttendanceBot Annual Plan on 11th Jan 2021 and completed the payment using the card ending with 6389. The way our third party payment tool works is, it automatically deducts the payment on the next defined date. As per your subscription, the next charge date is 11th Jan 2022 - which is why the payment took place and the money was deducted from this card itself.     Hope this helps. Do let us know if you need any other info, we're just an email away :)    Cheers,  Moira   ",1/11/2022

I don't know how to login since I signed up from Microsoft TEAMS !

","Hi Massimo,     Our live support is working fine. It can be an unstable internet connection that might be causing the issue.      Talking about shift creation, yes, a month is the highest duration you can set up for an employee. The idea is that shifts of the employee keep changing hence we created this by design.   ​  Hope this clarifies the doubt   Cheers,  Thea      ",1/11/2022

AttendanceBot,MSTEAMS,"Hello Thea.

Out trial is expiring soon and I'd like to check in for a quick question:
Is it possible to have a hybrid version of AttendanceBot in Microsoft Teams mode and Web mode?

Our team was quite happy using AttendanceBot but there are some inconveniences using it in Teams mode:

 *   The bot in Teams has been performing quite laggy sometimes
 *   The additonal confirmation of some simple leave types (like homeoffice) feels redundant and unnecessary
 *   The ""in"" takes quite some time, as it is necessary to choose a client first, wait again and then choose a project.
    *   The wish was there to simply say e.g. ""in ClientX, Project Y"" any using abbreviations for client and project

Unfortunately it is not possible to punch in or set up your calendar leaves via the website when using AttendanceBot in Teams mode.
A hybrid would be awesome. Otherwise the question: is it possible to switch to Web mode and have the team test this out for, let's say a week?
Or would this require a new tenant for web like I accidentally created at the start of the test?

Thanks and regards
David

Subject: 4 quick tips to get more out of AttendanceBot

 



Hi Madhur,

While you continue to explore possibilities with AttendanceBot, I thought you'd appreciate 4 quick tips to help hasten your discovery. 

1.    Get some teammates involved - AttendanceBot is truly a team tool, so its magic takes root with scale. Chat ‘introduce’ to the bot to start building your pilot team.

2.    Browse command options - message 'cheat sheet' to bring up a list of common commands. As an admin, you can even tailor this document to your team!

3.    Customize your experience - Have you explored the settings panel yet? From reminders and permissions to custom leaves  and approval workflow to project and client tracking, you can customize pretty much everything. Just message ‘settings’ to get behind the scenes.

4.    Announcements - Add @attendancebot to a team to stay in the loop with who's clocked in, who's on break, who has upcoming time off, who has a birthday, or your own custom reminders. 

There is - of course - plenty more to consider like employee docs, shared calendars, or Gusto integration, but these tips should be enough to warm up the engines. 

As always, I'm here for any questions you have, or you can  <https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjQyMDU1ODkxLCJuYmYiOjE2NDIwNTU4OTEsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiI2NnhzYzFpMGp4YmMwdHhmOXE5diIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJl9fcz1ldjE3d2pmdDZmN21mZzNvaWg2ayJ9.ZpCRtFAp9iv9LfulcP1RiVr9oV7p-zkM_EesFrLmH8Y> schedule a quick call to dive deeper on any of these topics.

I'm reaching out to about our trial and to be honest, I didn't realize it
was a trial period.

I'm the head coach of SubZero Robotics - FRC Team 5690 in Esko, MN and we
are using attendancebot for students to log their hours that they are
contributing to the team's progress and goals.  The students are required
to obtain a certain numbers of hours to attend competitions and also
possibly letter as robotics is a state high school league event here in the
state.

I'm looking to see if there is any possible way that we would be able to
continue to use attendancebot at no cost as we really like the simple
features as to how students can punch in/out and we as coaches get reports
to log the student's hours.  Those are the only features we use and will
plan on using.  In the past, we used a different software/app to log times
but then the students had two places to log into and this is so much easier.

Thank you for your time and hopefully you will be able to waive the fees.

Justin

","Hi Justin,     Thanks for letting me know this.     AttendanceBot is free for teams that have up to 5 users. When your team crosses 5 users, you will be asked to subscribe to a plan of your choice for all your users. However, I can see that your team size is more than 5 thus I suggest you opt for the Annual Plan & get an upfront discount of 20% on our base pricing.   ​   I've also looped in Dakota from our team to provide you with the best possible pricing for your team.     I hope this helps.   Cheers  Aaron      ",1/13/2022

We have tried to turn it on for different leave types, different users, and

no error code or anything it just stays dimmed with the loading circle.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi there,

I hope you're keeping safe and well.

A member of our staff, Eoin Furlong, had 26 days to start off with in January 2021 so that means 5 were brought over for him from 2020.

I have the following holidays on record:

3 day for Christmas 2021 (December 29th, 30th & 31st)
2 days - March 16th & 17th
2 days - June 3rd & 4th
5 days - July 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th & 16th.
2 days - August 27th & 28th
2 days - October 14th & 15th
0.5 day - 16th September
0.5 day - October 13th
1 day - November 5th
0.5 day - October 13th
0.5 day - November 8th
1 day - November 15th
2 days - December 2nd & 3rd
3 days - December 20th, 21st & 22nd
0.5 day - December 23rd

Total holiday requested & approved: 25.5

That means he would start the year with 0.5, add in his 22 and it should be 22.5 days but his account is showing 27 days.

Can you check this for me?

","Hi Abualhasan,     Thanks for reaching out.     Your account is currently under free trial, so there is no cancellation required from our end. If you still wish to discontinue, you could remove the AttendanceBot app from Slack. Here's a help article on how to uninstall the AttendanceBot app: https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000121227..     Meanwhile, I'll raise a request to our engineering team to delete your account from the database as well.   Cheers,  Moira   ",1/18/2022

Not sure if you received my previous email. Sending it again as none of us is able to use the bot due to the subscription issues.

Also, regarding Lynn's question on pulling reports by the 'Approved at' date, I have a meeting with my engineering team today where I am going to ask them to enable this for you.

Happy New Year! Hope you had a good relaxing break.



Maika has finished uploading employee details to shared google spreadsheet - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0Z6bjFaQr4ABmHIxdxdBNk0sn8_01c7sS20y6jfgwI/edit#gid=0.

I believe the accruals will not be populated as the account would like to maintain the source of truth in MYOB, something they discussed with you in the last session (after I left).



Lynn mentioned raising a few questions with you, for which she is awaiting your response. Are you able to provide the information and ready to proceed with the next step?





Thank you,



Kind Regards,

Feel free to add on the ones that aren't on the sheet already and we'd be ready to roll out the tool. You're gonna have to add all these members within the AttendanceBot Software Test Group team as well before we start to ingest data for them.  I am glad to sync up tomorrow 1 pm AEST if that works for you?

Hi Pranav,



Thanks for getting back to me. Maika is keen to get the system set up and rolled out.

She wanted to know what information you need from us to get started. The setup should cater for:-

  *   AttendanceBot setup is required for 3 regions, i.e., AU, NZ and CA
  *   AttendanceBot within each major region, i.e., AU, NZ and CA, should cater for sub-region like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane etc
  *   AttendanceBot should factor in departments like Operations, Account, Claims etc

Maika can provide the information. Just confirm if the previous format is okay or you need the info in any other format.



Happy to have the call tomorrow morning. Other than 10 -11 am, I am available.

Thank you for your email unfortunately this does not address my concerns that I voiced yesterday.


1.    I do not seem to have access to the system to update balances for employees, I have attached a screen shot for your information.

2.    I want this to be accessed easily from Teams, so I would like your thoughts on how members can just click on one button to access the Bot. Can I place the App prominently?

3.    Pricing:  We are a not for Profit business and we may be entitled to some discount.  Prahnav was to come back to me about this.

Can you help me with above as I cannot proceed with the new system if I cannot apply balances and leave allocations to employees.  Many thanks.

Just to note I spoke with pb@anaek.com<mailto:pb@anaek.com> yesterday about leave balance issues.

","Hi Karnrawee,     You can use the 'Leave Balance Report 2021' command as a direct message in the app to export the leave balance report for each leave type for the year 2021.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Rick,     Thanks for connecting on chat earlier.     I just heard back from the engineering team and they mentioned that manager was changed on 4 August 2021 from Xiangxuan Liu to Peter Zheng. However, they were not able to confirm who performed this change.     If you wish to update the manager for an employee, you could do either of the following:     1. Type in the command ""Change manager @Username"" to AttendanceBot and follow the prompt.     OR     2. Head to dashboard-->Personnel-->People, search for Peter's profile and update his manager & hit save.      I have also attached a few screenshots for your reference.

We decided to use the teams version of attendancebot and have purchased our Pro subscription for the account scharfschwerdt@fesforward.com<mailto:scharfschwerdt@fesforward.com>
Therefore, please delete the web version for scharfschwerdt@fesforward.com<mailto:scharfschwerdt@fesforward.com> and David.scharfschwerdt@fesforward.com<mailto:David.scharfschwerdt@fesforward.com>

Also a quick question on leaves. As a employer we receive sick notices in different ways, and not always is the employee capable to add a sick leave via attendance bot.
I must be able to add leaves manually in this case for my employees. Unfortunately I cannot find how to do this.

The current issue is that the people have not changed and the amount of
working hours a week has not changed.

As of February 1st:


   - Laura and Giulia will still work 8 hrs per 5 days a week with a 25 min
   lunch and 2 15 minute breaks.



   - Rima and Ingrid will work 8.5 hrs a day for 4 days and 1 day for 6hr -
   break for a 6hr shift only 20 mins



   - Mariana and Norma will work 8.5 hrs a day for 4 days and 1 day for
   6hrs - break for a 6hr shift only 20 mins.


Is this something that can be incorporated into?

Thank you

Hi Sylvia,

I'm Sarah, head of customer success at Harmonize. We're thrilled you're giving AttendanceBot a try on Slack!

As you get started you're welcome to let AttendanceBot guide you through first steps, but I like to check in because we do find most clients prefer to schedule a quick walk-through to accelerate their product discovery process. Saves everyone a little time :)

That said, you're more than free to keep things digital and email me questions directly, or access live chat through our site.

Here to help with anything you need.

Cheers,
Sarah

","Hi Moira,     Thanks for reaching out.     We noticed that AttendanceBot currently is not added to any of you slack channels, which is why the AttendanceBot announcements are not appearing on any of the channels.   ​   To add AttendanceBot to a channel, you could simply type the command ""/invite @AttendanceBot"" to the required channel. To set up channel notifications, you could simply head to AttendanceBot dashboard-->Notifications-->Channel Notifications. I have also added a few screenshots for your reference.   ​   Also, we have upgraded your to the Better Plan- so now you should have the access to time tracking feature.   Please access the dashboard, and do let us know if you need any other info - we're just an email away :)  ​   Cheers,  Moira   ",1/29/2022

Hi Anders,

I'm Sarah, head of customer success at Harmonize. We're thrilled you're giving AttendanceBot a try on Slack!

As you get started you're welcome to let AttendanceBot guide you through first steps, but I like to check in because we do find most clients prefer to schedule a quick walk-through<https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjQzNzI4NzY0LCJuYmYiOjE2NDM3Mjg3NjQsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiJmbGY1N2loaHl0ZWg3ZnB3YXEzYiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09d2VsY29tZSZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1kaXImX19zPWc5Z3ljMHRqejJtZDNyODZrdnEyIn0.Tat5Ec0Hj_FpATbTG_wJyZa-R_tlLdAjvKW3IcWg-2s> to accelerate their product discovery process.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi       Could someone help me with the following:     - What does ""Create employee level copy"" in the leave settings   - What happens when in the holiday settings at ""max accural allowed"" 365 stands, does the balance automatically change?  - I saw that the balance changed for the settings paternity leave and for family care leave automatically with strange addings or deductions, such as 0.833 etc. although we didn't make any manual changes, why does this happen? See attachment.     Looking forward to your help.     Kind regards Andrea    ","Hi Andrea,     Thanks for writing in.     The employee level quotas are changes in leave quotas for a particular employee only, this happens when you make changes in People>> Personnel >> Quotas & balances section of the dashboard for a particular user.   ​  Also, Max Accrual Allowed in days refers to the maximum number of leaves which the user can accrue in a month. If you set it equal to the Annual Leave Count In Days, it would mean that all the leaves left over with the user in that month, will lapse and he will only get the fresh number of leaves the next month.     I checked the quotas for Family care leave & can see that you have made some adjustments in the quotas on an employee level for yourself, I've attached a snapshot of the adjustment logs for your reference.     If you are facing issues configuring quotas for your team you can refer to this article for reference: https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000051255  Cheers,  Aaron   Cheers         ",2/2/2022

","Hi Katia,     Thanks for writing in.     The wage rate you specify in the profile page is calculated on hourly basis for that user, however, I understand your case here & would suggest you to set the wage rate as per the hourly salary for the user so that when you run the payroll report it shows the calculation correctly.     In this case it would be set as $22.57 ($65000/12 months/30 days/8 hours), I hope this clears your doubt.      Cheers  Aaron      ",2/2/2022

I would like to ask you a couple of questions that are on top of my head if that’s okay?  Have you reduced your team size of the organization, or marked some of these users inactive accidentally? I ask because these inactive users will not be able to use AttendanceBot?  I am happy to help reset this or help with any other questions you may have. Please remember, we are just an email away!  Hope you have an awesome week ahead :)  Cheers, Thea","Hi Thea,

Yes i have reduced my team size and about some inactive users i did it because they are no need to use AB for temporary.

Yes i have a question about this. does inactive user also count in monthly billing? i see our monthly bill last year has not deducted despite i deactivate some users.

 Hi Katia, 
   
 Thanks for writing in. 
   
 The wage rate you specify in the profile page is calculated on hourly basis for that user, however, I understand your case here & would suggest you to set the wage rate as per the hourly salary for the user so that when you run the payroll report it shows the calculation correctly. 
   
 In this case it would be set as $22.57 ($65000/12 months/30 days/8 hours), I hope this clears your doubt.

The problem seems to be that what we were looking for was a simple way to secure that we are not to many people in the office at the same time, but we wanted a simple calendar overview where the team could put in if they were working in the office or from home with an easy overview for all. The AttendanceBot seems to be more where you can report where you are, but in the demotalk I understood that the calendar view only could be shown in Outlook calendar or Google calendar and not in Slack ☹, so it seems like it does not fit our need…

","Hi Rose,     Thanks for writing in.     Yes, you can configure the AttendanceBot calendar as company-wide for reportee's so that whenever they view the calendar it shows everyone's availability as per the leave types, they can then filter the index to just check the working from office to view all the people working from office in the calendar.      I've shared a few sample snapshots for your reference.

","Hi Sylvia,     Thanks for writing in.     I understand your requirement here & the best way to configure this is by creating an office named 'PT Employees' in the People >> Office tab of the settings panel so that you can create a new set in the sick leave type & assign zero quotas for employees of this office (snapshot below), similarly for holidays as well you can assign holidays to specific offices excluding this one so that these employees don't get paid holidays.

AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hi Thea,

Thank you got your email.

I just went thru the new pricing, its a huge increase from our current subscription.

Since we are a small team (7 users) it’s quite expensive for us. As per the new pricing, the standard plan suits us the best as we just need basic functionality and one single function from the PRO + that is leave quota.

Can we look the same pricing as we have currently? Or we will have to look at some other options.

Hope you understand our concern.

Best regards,
Rasmeen

Hey Rasmeen,

To avoid any surprises I thought I’d share a quick heads up that your annual AttendanceBot subscription is coming up for renewal on 12th February.

Also, I am happy to inform you that we have come up with new pricing plans which have exciting new features, giving you more edge in tracking time and managing leaves. You can look at the plans by clicking here<https://www.attendancebot.com/pricing/>.
Please have a look at it and let me know which plan suits the best for your team and I will update your subscription.

As a thank you to renewing clients, we’d also like to offer 6 months free usage of one of our other powerful Slack tools - ExpenseTron<https://www.expensetron.com/> and OfficeAmp<https://www.officeamp.com/>. ExpenseTron<https://www.expensetron.com/> streamlines expense management in Slack, while OfficeAmp<https://www.officeamp.com/> turns Slack into a helpdesk, issue tracker, and AI-assisted knowledge base.

As soon as you’ve taken the 15 seconds you need to install OfficeAmp<https://www.officeamp.com/> or ExpenseTron<https://www.expensetron.com/>, just shoot me a quick reply and I’ll enable 6 months of free usage for your team.

In the meantime, we’re happy to chat about how we can better support you, so if you have any questions about renewal, feedback about your experience, additional support needs, or really anything at all you’d like to talk about, let me know and I’ll share a calendly link!

Cheers,
Thea

Hello!

Have you had a chance to consider referring?

I’ll be the first to admit AttendanceBot isn’t the sexiest tech out there, but our team believes firmly in the subtle power of a simplified process, which really makes a difference at businesses like yours.

Do give this a minute of thought if you have a chance.

More specifically, for each friend that joins us for a 20-minute call <https://calendly.com/customer-success-harmonize/attendancebot-referral>, we’ll thank you with $50 for the referral and your choice of Harmonize-branded apparel.

I sincerely appreciate your choice to partner with us and do hope you consider referring - there are few things more fulfilling for our small but mighty team ☺

We have stopped using AttendanceBot for quite awhile now but due to internal miscommunications, did not actually cancel our subscription.

","Hi Chien-Yu,     Sad to see you go.      We work hard to solve our client's needs but sometimes we're unable or things fall through the cracks. If you would do our team one big favor, can you share the reason for your cancellation? It may be too late for your team but we'd love to course correct for the future. Any suggestions or feedback that would make us a better fit is much appreciated!     Also, I've canceled your subscription from our end & ​shared your case with my billing team for a refund. We'll let you know once I hear back from them.       Cheers  Aaron      ",2/12/2022
AttendanceBot,Slack,"When people are filing for leave, should they file in their own timezone or own the company's timezone?


	
	

","Hi Camille,     Thanks for writing in.     Leaves do not have anything to do with timezone, you can use the 'Apply' command in the app and book leave for a particular date, day or multi-days. I've attached a sample snapshot for your reference.     FYI- Each user's timezone is fetched from his/her Slack workspace & is used for time tracking of punches of that user.   Cheers  Aaron      ",2/12/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Please note that I am no longer working at Royal Food Import Corporation.
the new Admin for Anaek Attendancebot should be Joshua Akomer (Josh@royalfoodimport.com)

When we try to remove my access from Attendancebot, it does not allow Josh to do that.

Please reply to all users in this email (you can drop me) because I will not be able to respond after today.

Thanks for reaching out. So far i didn't noticed any problems and was easy to understand and interact with the Bot.

I have noticed that you have a few different plans depending on the size of the team which are using it but I'm only using it in a very small team of 2 people and myself as the administrator.
My question is if we can keep using this as is without an subscription for now.

However my company is keen to find out if you have a partnership program, as i think we can also market attendancebot to our clients in the near future.

Hope to hear from you soon,

kind regards,

Could you please advise how to add maternity leave entitlement just for 1 employee Mariecar Abrique, if I create a new leave type for Maternity in types & quotas it will be added to everyone's which isn't required.

Alternatively, I could make an adjustment & add the 60 days entitlement & put a reason in comments, however, I would like to know if there is another way to apply this.

","Hi Trish,     Thanks for reaching out.     You could create a leave type on an employee level, so that only she could apply for it. Here is the step by step process you could follow to assign her maternity leaves.      Head to AttendanceBot dashboard--> Vacation Management-->Leaves-->Leave Types & Quotas.  Create a leave type called ""Maternity Leave"", add required keywords and hit save.  Now switch the toggle from ""Active"" to ""Inactive"" for this leave type.  Head to People-->Personnel and search for the required employee to open their profile.  Click on ""Leaves & Balances"" and select the arrow next to Maternity Leave.  Under Settings, add the count for maternity leaves and hit save.      I have also attached a few screenshots for your reference :) Can you please give it a try and let me if it works for you?

Thanks for writing in. You can integrate AttendanceBot with a Google/

However, the integration is one way where we can pass on data to a Google/

AttendanceBot,Unknown,minasl needs to teport to me. she is trying to put in for a  sick dsyv,"Hi Kathryn,     Thanks for reaching out.     I was able to go through her interactions with AttendanceBot, and my findings are listed below:      On 3rd Jan 2022: AttendanceBot prompted Minaal that ""It seems your manager USER_MENTION has been deactivated from your team. Please state the username of your new manager. You can give me the `@username` e.g. `@john`. If you don't have a manager, reply with `NA`.""  After this - multiple occasions in Jan and Feb, she tried checking her balance and applying leaves. However, AttendanceBot prompted her back to update her manager in order to continue.  On 3rd Feb 2022: She typed in ""NA"" to this prompt - which assigned herself as the manager.   On 25th Feb & 2nd Mar: She applies for Sick leave which gets approved and the notification is sent to her as she was the assigned manager.      I now see that her manager has been correctly updated to you i.e Kathryn. Going forward, you would be notified of her leaves.  Hope this was helpful. Do let us know if you need any other info, we're just an email away :)   Cheers,  Moira   ",3/3/2022

","Hi Chris,     ​Thanks for writing in.     Could you help me understand the reason as to why you want to shift from the annual to the monthly billing cycle? While we do offer both monthly and the annual options, the monthly billing cycle has a higher per user pricing and is less likely to be cost effective for you.     If you renew for the annual plan you'd get a 20% discount compared to monthly. I can further discount your pricing by 13% if you choose to renew for 18 months.   ​   If you go for the monthly billing cycle, you would be paying $804 for 12 months. However, if you renew at the discounted price for 18 months, you'd only be paying $846.     ​Looking forward to your response :)    Cheers,  Moira   ",3/4/2022

Hi again NITHISH,

How was your first week?

I see you have less than a week left on your trial and haven't tinkered much with AttendanceBot. If you're looking for more support, we're here to help! We can walk through the ropes of being an admin, assist in setting up your team, thinking through rollout, evaluating subscription options, or share best practices from our clients.

Thanks for reaching out to us. The pricing of AttendanceBot is dependent on
the feature set you'd like to use. Could you let me know if time tracking
interests you more or vacation tracking or perhaps both? And I am happy to

","Hello Pranav,

 

For the moment we would like to start with Vacation and Sick days tracking only.

 

We are evaluating other options and we would like to get a quote to see if your solution can be competitive if we take 65 users.

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Kumiko-san

Thanks a lot for your reply. You can install the bot by visiting this link https://www.attendancebot.com/time-tracking/ and clicking on Getting Started.

Also, it seems like your IT department may have a firewall blocking access to files sent in email. I have attached the file in the email.

Hi Kumiko

Thanks for your time today over the call. I do see another team with your domain. However, my belief is that they have uninstalled the bot. I have anyways increased the trial for this team so could you try accessing the bot? If not, let me know and we'll install on another team.

Here is an excel sheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CKANR9DjpVrf_i3FFZYLl4PVAxWibkRxHgY3LNEwbPE/edit?usp=sharing> that you may want to fill out for me to ingest your employee data. Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: 4 quick tips to get more out of AttendanceBot


Hi Eva,

While you continue to explore possibilities with AttendanceBot, I thought you'd appreciate 4 quick tips to help hasten your discovery.
1.     Get some teammates involved - AttendanceBot is truly a team tool, so its magic takes root with scale. Chat ‘introduce’ to the bot to start building your pilot team.
2.     Browse command options - message 'cheat sheet' to bring up a list of common commands. As an admin, you can even tailor this document to your team!
3.     Customize your experience - Have you explored the settings panel yet? From reminders and permissions to custom leaves  and approval workflow to project and client tracking, you can customize pretty much everything. Just message ‘settings’ to get behind the scenes.
4.     Announcements - Add @attendancebot to a team to stay in the loop with who's clocked in, who's on break, who has upcoming time off, who has a birthday, or your own custom reminders.

There is - of course - plenty more to consider like employee docs, shared calendars, or Gusto integration, but these tips should be enough to warm up the engines.

As always, I'm here for any questions you have, or you can schedule a quick call<https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjQ3MjM5NTkxLCJuYmYiOjE2NDcyMzk1OTEsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiJnaGF6N3k3eGE5cXM4OXY4bzhwYiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJl9fcz1nNW05NTRvOG96bGVyZm94dWVsdiJ9.g53nPE1tg-lTcMF4kIdG8LnWoAru5nwn3YDruiBQDeo> to dive deeper on any of these topics.

","Hi Eva,     Thanks for reaching out.     For clocking in or out, the employees would need to punch by directly messaging AttendanceBot. Also, I see that there are notifications set on multiple channels to announce the same. Once the employee would punch in/out by directly messaging AttendanceBot, the notifications would be triggered on these channels accordingly.   ​   I have attached a few screenshots for your reference as well :) If you prefer, we can get on a quick call to answer this or any other queries that you might be having.

I see that for the leave type ""Vacation"", the setting ""Show employee available"" is switched ON. Since this setting is ON, AttendanceBot is considering employees on Vacation as available and not triggering the required notifications.  ​   Can you try switching this toggle OFF and hit save? I have attached a few screenshots for your reference.  Please give this a try and let me know if this works for you :)   Cheers,  Moira   ",3/16/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,is there a way to prevent employees from clocking in before a shift starts?,"Hi George,  ​   Thanks for reaching out.     As it turns out, you cannot prevent an employee from clocking-in before the shift starts. I can definitely understand why this would be handy, though! I will pass it on to the product team and add your vote to this one.     You could however, set up ""Upcoming shift notifications"" so that all the employees will be notified for their upcoming shifts and accordingly punch in, here's the direct link for you : https://www.attendancebot.com/accounts/leave/notifications/  I have also attached a screenshot for your reference.     Please give this a try and let me know if this works for you :)  ​   Cheers,  Moira   ",3/16/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,It is giving errors when employees try to submit for leave when they do not have a shift scheduled for that time period. Is this avoidable?,"Hi Austin,     Thanks for reaching out     The engineering team did inform me that there indeed is a backend setting which will allow users to apply for leaves even if they do not have shifts assigned for that day.

","Hi Georgia,     Hope your week is shaping up well :D     ​To answer your questions:      1) Notification: You need to invite the app in your channel for it to start interacting. You can do that by going to the channel and typing ""/invite @attendancebot"". I can see you have added punch card notification to your ""Workflow test"" channel. Are you not getting notifications for this?     2) You need to deactivate users from your dashboard and the free plan will be auto-assigned to your account. Head to the dashboard and go to people --> personnel --> Click on the inactive button on the profile tile of the employee you wish to deactivate.    Cheers,  Thea      ",3/17/2022

Hope you have been well. Thanks for bringing this up. I did have my
engineering team take a look at this but we were unable to replicate the
issue completely as in my test workspace I only punched in once. However,
for us to troubleshoot the issue, would it be possible for you to send us a
small screencast of what you may be experiencing? Please be assured that I
would work with you to get the issue resolved.

Thanks

AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hi Sarah,

Thanks for getting in touch. AttendanceBot looks like a great tool that solved 95% of what we needed, but that extra 5% was really important to me. I had contacted someone through live chat to see if the reporting I needed was available, but they said it just wasn’t at that time.

From everything else I saw, AttendanceBot was great and I’m really sad that we won’t be able to use it. Thanks for making such a simple tool that can be used right in Slack.

Thank you.

","Hello,



Last week I sent the proposal for the CEO Interview Series given the number
of reviews under your GoodFirms profile. I haven’t heard from you since and
just wanted to drop in to see that you received it and if you had any
questions?



The interview procedure is quite simple to undergo.



●I'll mail you/your CEO the questionnaire which your CEO can answer & send
back to me.

●Once I receive the interview, we'll go through it & post it on our website.

●Once published, we can discuss having a summary article written by
GoodFirms for you to publish on your website.

Would you like to participate?

●Please write back with your consent & I'll share the questionnaire in my

I cannot get into the attendancbot.  This occurred after another member was having problems and weirdly she could only get into the old team of 4 we used for the trials and not the main one.

I tried to merge the teams but now I am locked out and cannot get in.

On another note there has been a team created by someone who should not be able to do so, and some people are reporting problems with logging their vacation.

Can we please have a call to look at these problems asap.

Thanks for getting back to me. Yes I did use the delete command i.e. I deleted the request for 10th June but when I re-applied it requested 46 days holidays!

This is where the issue lies and then when I tried to re-apply for the second set, i.e. forgetting about 10th June, it suggested I was looking for 102 days holidays!

And thank you for your screenshot but I am very familiar with how to apply for leave as I have been doing so for some time and also instructing everyone else how to apply for leave too and it has always worked for them.

Anyway I will try again as you say but not impressed at all by the way Attendance Bot explains away issues that occur that are not consistent with online instructions.

Hi Matt,

Thanks for reaching out to us over the chat.

We've investigated your punch-in issue & found out that the Read Slack Status setting and Update Status On Checkin settings are enabled for your team because of which status is getting updated and on that basis, the app is punching IN again and again.

We have disabled the Read Status Updates setting for your team & now it will not happen.

Cheers,
Aaron

","Hi Ryan,     In this case, I suggest you ask your users to change their Slack status manually instead of AttendanceBot changing it, this will ensure that their status is updated & they don't get punched in repetedly.    Cheers  Aaron      ",4/13/2022

I haven’t seen this before – can you please let me know what Fiona needs to do to delete the error message below so that she can log in correctly.

She also said that when she clocked out last evening at 5.30pm she got the same error message but the Bot automatically clocked her out at 6.30pm.

When she logged in this morning she got the same ‘duration’ error message. Please see screenshots below.

I would appreciate your help as soon as possible. If you need any further information please let me know. I also attach her timesheet for this week above but there is nothing sinister appearing here either.

Thanks,
Fiona

Hi Chris,



We've acquired all the 6 users shared in your excel to your BR-HR team. However, for the user Alaap Divekar the email that we have in our system differs from the one you shared in the excel sheet. If this user is using the 'Alaap.Divekar@brandregal.com<mailto:Alaap.Divekar@brandregal.com>' email address to access MS Teams then you have to add the user with this email in the BR-HR team so that we acquire the user will the correct email and then he can use the bot. I've attached a few sample snapshots on how to do so, please refer.



Also, to re-install the bot in your MS Teams team you have to follow the steps mentioned below:

  *   Click on the Apps section of your MS Teams & right click on the AttendanceBot Icon, you will get option to uninstall it (snapshot attached).
  *   Once done just head to the app directory of MS Teams & search for 'AttendanceBot', click on the app and it will show you button to 'Add' & another down arrow next to it saying 'Add to a team'. You have to click on the 'Add to a team' button to add the app to your desired MS Teams team. (snapshot attached)

Once done, AttendanceBot will be able to acquire all the members of that team automatically whenever you add a new member to that team, you can view those users in the Invite page of your dashboard to individually invite them to the bot as users.



Please check and let me know if this works for you. If you still have any confusion or doubts we are happy to jump on a quick call to clarify those, let me know your availability for the same.

Cheers

Hi Chris,

We investigated this case and found out that the bot is not present in team BR-HR in your MS Teams because of which the users are not getting acquired. Currently, the users in the excel sheet are part of team MRK-Team-000001, we can acquire these people in team BR-HR but in the future, if you wish to add more people then this problem will occur again, so I suggest you reinstall the bot in the team BR-HR.

","Hi Chris,     Did you add Pinakin Patel as a member of the BR-HR team? or did you just change the email & username of Apurvi Tyagi to Pinakin Patel?     However, I can see Aprurvi Tyagi is set as inactive in your team (snapshot attached) & there's no new user named Pinakin Patel added to your BR-HR team.      The ideal way to add a new user is by adding them as a member of the MS Teams team so that the bot acquires them & shows them on the People >> Invite page for you to introduce them to the application.     Let me know which one's the case so that we can assist you accordingly.   Cheers  Aaron      ",4/19/2022

Thanks for reaching out. We have unfortunately seen a significant portion of staff leave the department for other employment opportunities and are in the process of trying to fill 9 vacant roles, so once filled you should see those numbers going back up.

I did recently have a team member rejoin us, Ginger Lowry, so I loved her from inactive to active. Are there are additional steps needed to make sure her access in AttendanceBot is all set?

Thanks!

Emily

Thanks for the email and the info! Unfortunately, the installation is not accidental. Could I please cancel my subscription with your service? The Team loved it for a while, they just stopped using it because they felt it was a bit too invasive for our environment (we're a small group) and it was a duplication of effort with respect to overtime.

You have an awesome product and quite frankly, if it were not for the Team having to fill out a separate and additional overtime form, then I would've pushed for its adoption.

","Hi,

I reached out to you a few days ago about participating in our CEO
Interview Series and it occurred to me afterward that I may have missed the
mark!

I don't want ExpenseTron to miss out on the benefits of participating in
this interview series has brought to our members. It's Free of cost.

Are you the right person to talk to about this?

If not, could you please tell me who I should contact?

Thanks for your help!

I can still see Swaroop under Pune location rather than Singapore, the balances look correct but the location seems to be unchanged. Please confirm once this is corrected.

Got it. So here in India we have encashment of leaves on exit. Which means Swaroop will receive a pay out on his eligible leaves/balance in India and he will receive a fresh balance for his Singapore tenure.

For all transfer cases at PubMatic we treat them as exit from one location and new hire in another location wrt leaves.

Hope this clears the doubt.

Subject: Re: AttendanceBot Follow-up (March)

Ah, I think I understand but let me clarify once more.

For calculation simplicity let's say Pune accrues 12 leave/year and Singapore 24 leave/year. Swaroop, having transferred in March, would lose all 12 Pune leave and gain 20 Singapore leave (24*10/12).

My original assumption was Swaroop would gain 20 Singapore leave but keep 2 months of Pune leave (totaling 22). Since this is not the case we will calculate per above (only pro-rated leave per new office).

Thanks Karishma,
Dakota

Hi Dakota,

For both the employees we don’t want to give them an additional balance from their earlier locations. They are treated as transfers so their earlier balances are settled and the new balances are added based on the effective dates I have shared in my previous emails.

Resharing for your quick reference –

  *   Swaroop Kulkarni relocated from Pune, India to Singapore effective 10-Mar-2022
  *   Lashanne Phang relocated from Singapore to Redwood City effective 14-Mar-2022

Can you please share the explanation for your calculation below? I didn’t quite get the Singapore one. Singapore has 20 vacation days, 14 sick days which should be prorated. US region has no balance rules and the leaves are given as per manager’s discretion.
Swaroop & Lashanne will be treated as any other new hires who will get fresh balances pro-rated based on their new location rules & joining dates mentioned above.
Hope this explanation helps. Let me know if you have any more questions & also please share the final calculation numbers.

Hi Karishma,

Following up on items from our discussion yesterday:

  *   Open balance ticket/issue: employees have been deactivated but engineering is still looking into the balance root cause so we can take the right action.
  *   New hire balances: can I confirm the below

     *   Pune sick, bereavement, and vacation will be pro-rated
     *   Singapore sick, child leave, and vacation will be pro-rated
     *   Original 2022 accrual will be prorated 2/12 for original office and 10/12 for new office. So Swaroop will get 2/12 Pune + 10/12 Singapore = 13*2/12 + 20*10/12 = 18.83 vacation.

  *   Sick command: it appears that you have both a ""Sick"" leave and ""Casual / Sick"" leave, of which only ""Casual / Sick"" accrues for Pune.

     *   Short term: ""csl today"", ""csl mar 16"", or ""casual 3/18"" all work as quick commands.
     *   Mid term: I'm not sure why there are different types of sick leave for different offices, but you'll have to tell me if you want to pursue a merge or leave them be for now.
     *   Long term: I'm having trouble thinking of quick fixes for your sick-first policy, but I'll still discuss with engineering. It's certainly possible to build logic like ""always use sick first"" but it's not an easy lift and seems like communication of internal policy might be better suited.
Best,
Dakota

Thanks for reaching out. I have had a bit of a play around and I think I've got the hang of most things. The only question I really have applies to breaks. Is there a way to automatically apply a lunch break without requiring staff to actually punch in and out for it? We deduct 30 minutes for lunch each day, so it would be nice to have the ability to have this apply automatically and not have it dependant on staff punching in and out for their break.

That's weird, how do we lock employees from being able to change their
managers? Obviously this is a concern as staff shouldn't be able to change
their reporting lines - it should be locked only to admins

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hello,

Today (the 6th of May) was our billing date and the Attendance Bot stopped working. In the meantime we paid our subscription and all is well, but we have a few questions:


  *   My previous understanding was that the card associated with our account will be automatically charged. This did not happen. Is there a way we can enable this?
  *   If we cannot enable the automatic payment, how can we avoid in the future the downtime that happened today?

Even if the downtime was only a few hours, it was not very pleasant. This would have been even more unpleasant if I were to be on PTO.

I guess my question is, couldn't we pay our subscription before it expires? You could send a payment link via email lets say 7-14 days before.

Thank you,

Alexandru Butnar

","Hi Alexandru,     Thanks for reaching out.     1. Automatic charging of the card has been enabled - I see that the invoice draft was created and would have been automatically sent out (in the next 29 mins) to charge the amount on your card. However, now I see that you subscribed again - so I would go ahead and cancel the previous subscription to avoid duplicate charging.     2. We try our best to make sure our customers never face any such downtime. However, if at all it happens (like it did unfortunately happen today) - you could simply reach out to us, our team would make sure the issue is addressed & resolved then and there.

The fact that you guys do accounting and bookkeeping services and administrative support to small- and medium-sized businesses, simply amazing! More power to you :)    I am just checking in to make sure you are using the app in the best way possible and making the most out of it. Here are a few tips that you could try for your ease:  1) You can set up notifications by first inviting AttendanceBot by typing ""/invite @attendancebot"" in the channel and head to ""Notifications"" tab on the dashboard to do the setting for the same.  2) Do Vacation Management for your employees by updating the active feature set to ""Both"" (refer screenshot)   3) Type in the command ""report"" to AttendanceBot and follow the prompt to generate various reports.  I can set up a training session as well for you and your employees where we can have a 15-min call for employees to walk them through the product, answer any questions they may have, and later a 15-min deeper dive session just for you and the HR.   Hoping to hear from you soon :)  Cheers,  Moira","Hi Team,     Just following up on my previous email, can I help with anything?

Hi Vivian



I see that you have scheduled a demo with us on Tuesday. I just wanted to
check if you have been facing an issue with the bot just so I can resolve
this right away without any delay. Do let me know and I'll work with my
engineering team to get it resolved.



Thanks

","Hi Pranav,



Am surprised to hear this out! We are not asking something new! If the
report which is generated doesn’t provide leaves taken by employee, whom
should be blamed? In this case your report itself is null and void!



Moreover, if you see the header of the report, it is very clearly written
leaves taken by employee. (Which was a ask from us from the day of
inception) and this was not resolved by your team from then on! And if the
Bot is not giving us the right information who needs to be blamed here? Why
Unbxd should pay you customisation charges?



Happy to connect over a call!

","Hi Catalina,     First of all, welcome to AttendanceBot :)     The reason weekly overtime is greyed out is that you have enabled ""TOIL"" and it's applicable for daily overtime only. If you wish to set up weekly overtime, you need to toggle off TOIL.      Cheers,  Thea      ",6/15/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Team,

Is there a chance that employee profiles become inactive after a certain time span if they don't use their leaves?
Example - Jessica Gibson (RWC) I had added her profile at the time she joined and today when I checked she was not able to use her leaves.

I went on to check her profile on AttendanceBot she had automatically become inactive. I have now added her in the active list but not sure why this happened.
Can you please investigate and let us know on it?

She’s already taken 3 of these days, so her balance should be 12/15 and when I create an employee-level change by changing her balance, it says 17/15, which doesn’t make sense. Can you explain what I’m doing wrong and let me know how to fix this? Thanks!


	
	

","Hi Carol,     I can see that yesterday, you have deleted Marie's leaves that she had applied for October (13 days). As you deleted them, it got added back to her leave balance. Please check the screenshot.     ​   That's why her balance is now 17 days. If you wish to make her PTO balance to 12, just head to her profile --> quotas and balances --> adjustments --> subtract 5 days and hit save.   ​New balance will start reflecting :) Can you please give this a try?

We are returning (yet new) users, and I’ve had a couple of questions about
how to implement Officeamp, but I’m not getting a timely response at all
from Support. we are confused as to how users who’ve already been added in
the backend are supposed to initiate a request. The app has been integrated
into Slack, and I see it in the apps section of my left NAV, but I’m not
sure about the rest of my team and they do not understand how to access it.
By the way, I renamed it requestline - one word. I think it’s been over a
week and haven’t heard from anyone. Dakota is out on vacation until the
20th and so we have been unable to use the functionality at all.
We’re supposed to be signing up for a monthly subscription after the free
trial but I am concerned about doing this based on the support that we
aren’t receiving.

","Hi Suzanne,     Thanks for reaching out to us.      I would like to understand the context for future accrual? do you mean upcoming months for this year or are you referring to next year?      Also, you can enable the ""Negative balance"" button for your employees to request PTO even if they don't have the required leave balance. However, even if the PTO is for 2023, the balance will be deducted from this year. For eg: if the employee applies for leave in 2023, the PTO balance will be deducted from 2022.    Cheers,  Thea      ",6/20/2022

Subject: Re: Personal Leave Details in Calendar

Hi Jeremy,

​Currently, we don't have the possibility to do that. I think Caroline from your team had raised this request to one of our team members and we have added it to our backlog. We are still working on the timeline and will surely keep you posted as to when we roll this out.

However, I am trying to figure out a temporary workaround for this and will share an update with you by next week :)

Cheers
Thea

Just checking on the status of this ticket? With the first notification of my leave happening this afternoon I'm pretty eager to not have the notes show up there if at all possible. I fear that's what may happen since it's showing up in the calendar. Thank you!

AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hello,  i've just started my free trial using attendanceBot through Slack.  My biggest question is does the software track inactivity, for example what prevents my remote employee from just clocking in, going to the beach for the day, then clocking out later in the day?  Will there be some sort of inactive report or something?

I am following up on my email below, could you please look into and advise? Bobbie Denehey has been following up about her access as well.


  1.  Bobbie Denehey’s access to the Claims team calendar – Bobbie has tested it, she still can’t see the Claims team calendar. She can only see her leaves & her manager’s leaves (as below). Can you look into her access? Thanks for the screenshot, lemme check once again.

  1.  Pending leave report – was there any update on this one? We have rolled this out, I would be enabling this for you tomorrow and you can use it.



  1.  Run leave reports by approval date – was there any update on this one? Still hidden behind a backend switch, my engineering team would pick this up next.
Thank you.

Hi Apurva

Couple of updates just ahead of our call.

  *   Bobbie should have viewing rights now. If you could check with her that would be great.
  *   In the list of feature requests, you had requested for the admin being able to upload medical certificate on behalf of the employee, that will be rolled out Monday
  *   I have attached a sample format of the pending leaves report along with the email, let me know if that looks good to you.
Cheers

I see 10 users in our account.  The thing that I think may be causing a discrepancy is a bit of a bottleneck for us.  I am not sure how this plays into our numbers but as soon as we add someone into slack they are added as an active user in Attendance Bot.  Most of the people we add into SLACK do not need to be in attendance bot.  We try to go in and mark them as inactive after we add them to slack but it is a bit of a delay.  Is this impacting our numbers? Is there a way to keep this from happening each time?

Attendance Bot could be great for us, but it just doesn't track idle time.
If it were to track when my remote employees are idle I'd definitely be
using it.  Basically I need something that isn't too intrusive, but at the
same time I don't want an employee to be able to type ""in"", go to the beach
for the day and return and type ""out"".  I'd want to see how much time during
the day was idle.

Thank you for your time,

We would appreciate if you could help us get some configurations figured out. We've been using the app for about a week now to get familiar with how it works, and we'd like to get a few things sorted out before we start moving to the next stage of deployment.

Here are some of the questions we have regarding the leaves configurations and shifts management:


  *   *Can we set up a different type of leave based on the employee Gender, i.e.: Maternity Leaves?
  *   *Different break types: i.e.: Lactation periods for women (until the baby is 6 months old), Running errands (can count as half days, or hour breaks).
  *   *How can we set up compensation hours, instead of paying for overtime, we accrue overtime hours which we can later use as a leave type to compensate for the extra time. We also have compensation days if we work on holidays, meaning we accrue double the number of hours per hour worked on a holiday.
  *   *Independent Reports for Managers: We need to configure a scheduled report so each manager can keep track of their team's timesheets.
  *   *Rollover rules: If the End of Year Holiday lands on a weekend, then it can be rolled over to the next year.
  *   *Can we upload vacation balances in bulk? As we have different balances accrued for some of our coworkers, depending on their joining date, compensation days and tenure years.
  *   *Holiday Calendar: Can we upload or import a holiday calendar?
  *   *Sick leaves: employee must submit a medical certificate to apply for a sick leave, although these can be done later, can this be included in the comment section of the sick leave?

We'd appreciate if we could schedule a follow up appointment to discuss these configurations if they can be accomplished using the bot. At least the ones we can actually configure.
If we could set up a short meeting on Thursday, 11:30 am, CST or Honduras Time. Please include all members CCd in this email:

Ever time me and my members het messages because 12 am and 12 pm is very confusing, when the persons are not used to have that system.

Following up on the question below.  We are eager to move forward on a decision.  If AB is not able to provide a good visualization of leaves (as per the calendars referenced below) we'll likely have to use another tool.

I'm including Sarah as I understand that there is an API.  We may be able to solve the visualization if we have access to the API to populate into our own views (although I would still like to understand the issue noted below).

Hi Pranav,

I'm following up on our call from today.  I've confirmed that all of our leave types now have the following settings:

  *   Show Leave Type
  *   Show leave on calendar
[cid:image005.png@01D89096.5974F180]

However, there are 2 issues with this:

  *   In https://www.attendancebot.com/accounts/leave/team/calendar/ a user does not see accurate status'.  See 2 attached screenshots.  You can see from admin screen shot, I am Working from office on Thursday and Bogdan is working from Home today.  However, in User view, they all show as ""leave"".
  *   In the ICS feed (https://www.attendancebot.com/calendar/8a1f0ca251.ics/?emp=4427235&ts=1656964558) it still only shows ""Leave: Users Name"" rather than showing Vacation or Working from Home.  Attached is the ICS export for confirmation that the data is not in there.

Having some issues with the reminders. I turned on the evening reminder to checkout and turned off the check in reminder.

What happens is I tend to get a check in reminder and no checkout.  I kind of expect to not receive a checkout reminder if I haven’t checked in, but to receive I check in reminder when I intentionally left that unchecked?

Also I disable all reminders and still seem to get check in requests.

Hi Pranav & Support,

I am following up on my email below, could you please look into and advise? Bobbie Denehey has been following up about her access as well.


  1.  Bobbie Denehey’s access to the Claims team calendar – Bobbie has tested it, she still can’t see the Claims team calendar. She can only see her leaves & her manager’s leaves (as below). Can you look into her access? Thanks for the screenshot, lemme check once again.

[cid:image001.jpg@01D89521.EE9A0400]

  1.  Pending leave report – was there any update on this one? We have rolled this out, I would be enabling this for you tomorrow and you can use it.



  1.  Run leave reports by approval date – was there any update on this one? Still hidden behind a backend switch, my engineering team would pick this up next.
Thank you.

Hi Apurva

Couple of updates just ahead of our call.

  *   Bobbie should have viewing rights now. If you could check with her that would be great.
  *   In the list of feature requests, you had requested for the admin being able to upload medical certificate on behalf of the employee, that will be rolled out Monday
  *   I have attached a sample format of the pending leaves report along with the email, let me know if that looks good to you.
Cheers

I am just waiting to get a word from engineering about the pending leaves report so it would be great if we can meet Friday morning instead of tomorrow.

Thanks

Hi Catalina,



I am afraid we can't manually add hours in TOIL as they are automatically added to the TOIL balance of the employee. Can you share the name of the employee who's TOIL hours weren't added? I will get it checked from our team. 



Cheers,

Thea

I am afraid, currently importing team data can only be used for importing personnel profile and leave balance.

I will pass it on to the product team and add your vote to this one   Cheers,  Moira   ",7/12/2022
AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hi Sarah,

we have been in contact before for any questions about time tracking for
our personnel via attendancebot. So I'm contacting you, however feel free
to refer me to a more suitable account manager.

We have experienced some issues in recent times that certain commands were
unfortunately not implemented correctly, when communicating them to the
slack bot. Especially with the check-in via the command ""in"" there were
problems again and again, that the bot only after multiple entries or not
at all correctly recorded the status of the respective employee.

Are there currently any problems we should know about, or do you have
similar reports from other users? What do you think is the best way to
avoid these issues in the future?

Looking forward to your feedback.

AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hi Sarah,

I did have a few questions!


  1.  We have employees that are paid hourly, but most are salaried. Can I set up a notification for just the hourly employees to clock in and out?
  2.  The reports that come up in Slack are a little confusing. Is there a report I can run that will just give me the number of leave days that each employee has used YTD? I know I can schedule reports, but I’m wondering if there’s an option to run it instantly. We have unlimited leave, but still want to monitor how many days each employee is using.
  3.  I back-entered leave days from this year going back to January. If I mis-entered one of those entries, is there a way I can go back and edit it?
  4.  Is there a way to make the default screen for timesheets only show one employee “Office” or “Department”? We want to track timesheets for our hourly employees, but none of the salaried employees will be using this feature, so there’s no need for them to show up in that portion of the app for us. Additionally, if we began a paid plan, would there be a way to adjust the monthly cost to reflect that only a few employees would be using both services, and most would only be using the Leave Tracking?
  5.  Would you be able to walk me through the Onboarding Tasks section of the app? Just some more context about what it looks like in action would be great.

Thank you so much for your help!

I had a question. I know that attendancebot has the capability to sync to Outlook calendar and creates a separate calendar that is populated by all events input into attendancebot.

","Hi Melissa,     Thanks for getting back to me. We offer4 major capabilities in the system  1) Track employee records (profile) - employee meta data, their records like w2 and performance review records, extra data like food allergy, T-shirt size etc 2) Time off - you setup the rules (personal days, vacation, sick etc) and then people apply  3) Time tracking - use for doing payroll for hourly folks or just keeping track of how much time are people working or going a level deeper to understand how much time are people spending on different projects so that you know which projects are a time suck and which ones are smooth sailing 4) Shift scheduling - setup when folks work and provide them additional context for work like if someone is doing customer support they might do it via email on one day and twitter the next While the system is paid (https://www.attendancebot.com/pricing/), it comes with a free trial of 14 days and if your team size is below 5, it's for free.   ​   I am confident that we are easier to use and if you have any questions, please let me know, I am right here!

Hi Catalina,



I understand your concern here but I am afraid we can't manually add hours in TOIL as they are automatically added to the TOIL balance of the employee. This is by system design however I can help you add those hours from backend. 

​


Can you share the name of the employee and their TOIL balances?

","Hi Paul,     Thanks for reaching out.     1. Project tracking is a part of PRO plan only and cannot be accessed if you subscribe to a Standard Plan.     2. You can control the status of the users to be active or inactive in this case. Only Active users would be able to interact with AttendanceBot. For switching their status, follow this step wise guide : https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000093807     3. AttendanceBot is free for teams with 5 active users or less, meaning such teams get access to the highest tier plan PRO for free. For teams with more than 5 active users, you get a free trial of 14 days post which you would need to subscribe to a paid plan.      Please give this a try and let me know if this works for you :)   Cheers,  Moira   ",7/22/2022

","Hi Andrew

I did have a word with my engineering team about this and though this does
not seem to be on our roadmap, we would be happy to make a customization
for you post subscription. This would only apply if you choose to go for
the annual plan and should you want to opt out of using AttendanceBot
within the first 30 days, I'll issue you a full refund of the amount.

Thanks

I am in the process of setting up our hourly accruals for PTO/sick. So far, my employees have used the default PTO/sick which are fixed. How can I clear everything out of the calendar to start fresh?  If I can't clear out all pto/sick to date, how may I delete them individually?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi,     When some users try to apply for vacations they receive the message ""you cannot apply leave for these dates as there is no shift assigned for this particular dates"".

Looking forward for your support.     Thanks.","Hi Nubia,     When an employee doesn't have any shift assigned for a particular day let's say on Tuesday, then AttendanceBot assumes that the employee is on leave/not working.

AttendanceBot,MSTEAMS,"Hi there,

I hope you're keeping safe and well.

At the beginning of the year we turned off the accrual for all staff, however, it appears that days have been added and marked under accrual.

For example, Philip Kelly had 17 days accrued on March 1st, this is incorrect as we do not want any days added via the accrual process.

Can you please check over all staff and any days that have been marked as accrued need to be removed.

Thanks,

Happy Tuesday!

Our summer school season is coming to a close. We greatly appreciate the use of your AttendanceBot that is fully integrated with MS Teams. The application supported our dynamic team with real-time information on our attendance including those who are available to provide services to our students. The best features are the punch board window, shift management and reports!

We plan to end the subscription on September 15, 2022 (Invoice #015858CE-0003)  for this season.

We will communicate back for future subscriptions.

Thank you.

","Hi Fernando

Thanks for letting me know. My billing team, while checking their records,
mentioned that you weren't billed for a month I guess.

I'll share the invoice with you soon if you could ask your billing team to
process that, it would be much appreciated.

Cheers

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hey Ilya,  I always love to see clients succeed and clearly you’re doing something right. In fact, looks like your subscription has been unable to keep up.  Attached you’ll find a month-by-month breakdown of your users measured again initial subscription of 27 users, and now has grown to 37 users - please let me know if monthly users don’t line up with your experience.    I do apologize if this comes as a surprise but since your annual renewal is coming up on 29th Aug it seems like as good a time as any to reconcile the books.    Also, I am happy to inform you that we have come up with new pricing plans which have exciting new features, giving you more edge in tracking time and managing leaves. You can check out the plans here (https://www.attendancebot.com/pricing/) and let me know which plan suits the best for your team and I will update your subscription.   Please make sure you pick a plan at the earliest as we will be migrating your account 2 days before your renewal date  In the meantime, we’re happy to chat about how we can better support you, so if you have any questions about renewal, feedback about your experience, additional support needs, or really anything at all you’d like to talk about, let me know and I’ll share a calendly link!  Cheers, Thea","Hello,

New plans will not work for us. Even the cheapest plan is way too
expensive. If we no longer can use our discounted plan, then I have to ask
to cancel our subscription starting 03 SEP 2022.

Hey Guys this is similar to last year where you charged us for more than the actual number of users. Yes we do have 29 people registered in Slack at the moment. Most are guest users. I just confirm with my Slack Manager and we only have 8 actual users for expense tron and last month one of them is no longer a user. So we actually only have 7. But its ok you can charge us for 8. Please refund us the charges for 21 people. Thanks guys!

","Hi Hendry,     Our billing system verifies the number of users active in your account couple of days before your subscription is due for renewal and charges accordingly. In your case, it seems like guests users were also marked active in your team and ExpenseTron picked it as active users. I suggest you deactivate the profile of these users to avoid such instances.      Here's how to can do it:   Please type ""Settings"" as a direct message to the app and click on the link. Once you open the dashboard, head to people tab present on the left panel --> personnel. Toggle off the button present under the active column. Please check the screenshot below    Talking about the refund, considering you have 7 members who will be using the app, the pricing will be $3 * 7 users * 12 months = $252 + $228 (Base fee) = $480. As you have already made the payment for $1272, we will be refunding $792 to your account.      I have initiated the refund process from our end and it will take 5-10 business days to reflect in your account :)   Cheers,  Thea      ",8/19/2022

I recommend you should go for annual plan as you save a flat 20% discount.      Here's what you need to do now: Activate the profiles of additional 3 users from the settings dashboard by going to people --> personnel tab and click on ""Active"" button present next to the profile tile of the employee. Do remember to toggle off ""Show active personnel only"" tab to see these inactive profiles.     ​   Once you activate the profile, click on this pricing link (https://www.attendancebot.com/T0NNR1TT6/pricing/) and select ""subscribe"" button present on the plan and you can complete the payment.   ​   Can you give this a try?   Cheers  Thea      ",8/29/2022

Marissa Ramirez has an out punch of 12am and both her and myself are unable to edit this punch to 5pm on 8/26. I am not sure what I am missing. Every time I edit it to 5pm, it reverts back to midnight.

Unfortunately, there isn't a way to turn off manager notification for certain leave types.      One potential workaround can be that since all leave types for you are auto-approve, everyone can set themselves as their own manager and then you create a channel where you can announce the ""sick"" and ""vacation"" days and all managers or perhaps everyone in the company can be a member of that. Alternatively, managers can rely on the calendar where you can sync just the ""sick/vacation"" days.     ​Happy to get on a call to understand your needs further so that I can go back to the product team with your feedback and get it added to our product roadmap.   ​    Cheers  Kanav         ",8/29/2022

The application is too costly and complicated to work for my needs.,"HEY Stephen,     We feel bad to let you go :(  Thank you for being a customer for 6 months. It's a bummer that you have decided to cancel now!     We value the long standing relationship that you've had with us and we want to support you. I can see we have already offered you a discount on the monthly plan.   I have discussed your case internally and have chalked out two special pricing for you:     1) For monthly plan: we can offer you $4.5 per user with a 5-star review on G2  2) For Annual plan: You save flat 20% if you opt for annual plan which is priced at $4 per user/monthly. However, instead of 12 months, I can give you 1 additional month so you pay for 12 months and can use the app for 13 months with a 5-star review on G2.   ​   Also, I can offer you a training session for you and your team.   ​   Please let me know which option would you pick :)    Cheers  Thea      ",9/6/2022

unfortunately, we didn't have much time to check the service the first week. But we have planned a long session on Friday where we will integrate the tool internally.

But we are sure that we want to further integrate the product, so we would like to buy a license.

At the moment we are still trying to integrate the automatic status updates, i.e. that it is displayed directly to the user as a status when someone checks IN or OUT. This doesn't really work now, even though we've set permission.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Sarah,

Thanks for checking in. I really like the app Attendancebot has created.
The ability to create different offices in different locations and time
zones, with different calendars is not only intuitive and extremely easy to
use, but gives you options you didn't realize you even wanted/needed.
There are a couple of items that would hold me back from purchasing a plan
today. Perhaps you can give me some clarity on the following issues: Our
company has employees and contractors whose time needs to be tracked-
namely for scheduling purposes and for billable hours. Does attendancebot
support contractors- independent and 3rd party? If so, how can I make that
distinction within the app? And, is there a way to selectively sync the
employees to Gusto? (I don't need contractor time ported over there.)
Lastly, I'm curious if you have any tips on ways to integrate time tracked
with Quickbooks? (The billable hours portion.) Would it be
accomplished using a report per employee/contractor?

Thank you in advance for your insight.

Sincerely,

Appreciate the call but we can't deal with these issues any longer. I have put in another request to cancel my subscription at the end of the month as this is causing us way to many issues and frankly it's easier to do this manually at this point.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"We have an issue with the Offices functionality.  We created 2 offices and updated all users to those 2 offices through the Import User function.  We really only have 1 office, but some home-based staff are in provinces with different holidays - so it seemed the only way to do this was to assign people to one of 2 offices for the purposes of holidays.     Now, when a user indicates ""working from office"" status, they are asked which office they are working from.  We don't want this prompt but I don't see a way to disable it.     (Note that I have now uploaded a new user list with the offices removed until we resolve this).",Asked PB,9/12/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Sarah,

I'm interviewing now to hire up to 6 people by the end of the year. Right now, it is just myself, but I want to use AttendanceBot to communicate where each person will be working or if they are out on vacation or sick as well as indicate if they will be working in the office as we are hybrid. Can you please let me know what the subscription options are for a team like mine. I mean we are growing and I'm the only one for now, but hopefully someone will be onboarding in the next 2-4 weeks.

","Hi Jensen,     ​Employees cant add any comments while clocking their punches. Can you elaborate on where Kayla is marking her notes.   If she is working on different things, I suggest you create different projects like teaching, admin, private, etc and when she punches in, she will get option to select it. You can then track Kayla's hours.      Cheers  Thea      ",9/16/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Is there any way to have an option on the calendar view to have a colored bar appear over multiple days off and to have notes visible - for the use of knowing who's covering that shift for that time off?


	
	

","Hi Amanda,     We do have dedicated colour assigned to a specific leave type in the calendar and the notes included the comments added by the employees while applying leave for eg: if an employee applies for vacation, green colour indexes the vacation leave. When he/she is requesting leave, they can add comments like travelling to Miami. This note will be visible when you click on the vacation.      However, these notes wont have the details of the person covering the shift as a replacement. If the employee is aware about it, he/she can add it in the comment section and it will reflect on the calendar   Cheers  ​Thea       ",9/16/2022

AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hello Sarah,

We are extremely disappointed with Slack/Attendancebot/Aneek. We've
communicated with the subscription department that we wanted to switch our
account from annual to monthly. We were assured this would happen. We
updated our credit card information, per instructions of Thea in the
department and now our card has been charged the entire annual fees. We
demand a full refund of this annual charge.

Please contact me as soon as possible with confirmation of this change. If
I do not hear back from you with a confirmation of this refund, I will be
forced to dispute the charge with our bank. I will also attach here our
emails with Thea/Slack/Attendancebot.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Warm regards,

","Hi Michelle,     Thea here.      Let me explain what happened here: I was in touch with your colleague Simon for changing the current Annual plan to monthly. Your annual renewal was due on 10th of Sept and the credit card had expired. The billing system was re-trying to charge your card since 10th however it was failing but we made sure your account doesn't get closed. Your colleague Simon reached out to us on 17th Sept for the change in plans. Since the payment for annual didn't go through for 7 days, I gave a grace period till 21st Sept until I have a confirmation from Simon so that your team can continue using the app without any interruptions   ​   In my last email, I mentioned that once the credit card details are updated, I can create a fresh subscription. He did update the card details and before the change to monthly plan reflected, the pending charge for Annual plan went through.      Here's the next step:  As you have decided to go for monthly plan, I am deducting the money for this month (41 users * $6 per user = $246) and refunding the differential charges i.e $1968 - $246 = $1476 to your card.    Cheers  Thea      ",9/21/2022

","Hi Napat,     We noticed that AttendanceBot had been uninstalled from your end back in June and emailed you (settakid@gmail.com) on 30th June asking about it.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hello,

I've noticed that our Overtime settings keep getting reverted back to all 0's.  This has happened numerous times.  Each time, we reconfigure the Overtime settings for our California requirements, and then those settings stick for 1 or 2 payroll cycles, and then they reset to 0.  Is there something we're doing wrong in regards to these settings?  Or some reason why they continuously revert to 0's?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Sarah,

Thanks a lot for your warm reminder!

We are so inspired by how convenient it is to record our daily attendance through AttendanceBot, and we really hope that we can use it to manage our office attendance in the future.

May I ask if you could kindly extend our free trial until October 14th, since my current free plan will expire on October 4th, but I was too busy last week to let my colleagues have a try on it.

I suppose it would be clearer and more convincing if I can have a general idea about how AttendanceBot improves the way of recording and managing attendance in my office before I seek the approval to subscribe to AttendanceBot.

I’d appreciate it a lot if you could help us extend the free trial period!


Thanks,
Cheryl

We are a non-profit organization that allows some key volunteers to
interact on our slack workspace. But they do it need attendancebot. It
appears that our setting was set to automatically add them to attendance
bot. However, they do not need it and I have deactivated them. I have also
disabled this functionality.

If we owe you for previous months when we did not catch this, let me know
how much. However, going forward we still only need subscription for 6
users.

Please let me know if/what else we need to discuss.

Hi Lauren,

It looks like you and several colleagues installed AttendanceBot in your MS Teams workspace earlier this year, but the welcome and instructional emails we sent never got to you.

While the opportunity may have passed, I did want to share our apologies for any onboarding frustration and offer one on one assistance if you’re open to giving AttendanceBot another shot - the software is really quite good.

Let me know with a note either way, hope all is well.

AttendanceBot,MSTEAMS,"Hi Sarah,

While I have been testing AttendanceBot for a while, there are a couple of issues that are preventing me from rolling it out to my team.

It would be very useful to be able to set weekly working hours on each team member – as my contracted hours are 40 hours per week and my team members are 37.5,

The other thing it to look at how ‘time off in lieu’ is worked out. From my testing it would be great if someone worked less than their working hours in a week that it automatically reduced their TOIL balance. Perhaps this could be a ‘Flexitime’ mode that is enabled, as I know it wouldn’t work in all environments.

This would be useful as my team cover events that could take place over evenings and weekends. So I get them to balance their time over a Monday to Sunday window – with the ability to accrue TOIL if workload doesn’t allow them to flex their time.

I hope this make sense but I would be happy to chat about their further if you think it would be useful.

Kind regards,
George

Hi George,

It looks like you installed and test drove AttendanceBot in your MS Teams workspace earlier this year, but the welcome and instructional emails we sent never got to you.

While the opportunity may have passed, I did want to share our apologies for any onboarding frustration and offer one on one assistance if you’re open to giving AttendanceBot another shot - the software is really quite good.

Let me know with a note either way, hope all is well.

Could some one please look into this request from our South Africa team please regarding reporting:


  1.  With regards to the Leave Summary Report, even though this report is customizable, I still found that it gives me the total of the actual leave days submitted on the system by an employee for a specific period. We are looking for a nett leave balance for a specific period (i.e opening balance + 1.75 days leave accrual for the period - leave days taken for the period).  This brings me back to the Leave Balance Report which is the most suitable to provide this information, but the report needs to be customizable. We need to pull nett leave balances for a specific period (i.e 01 Sept 2022 - 31 Sept 2022). I had a look at the other reports on the app and noticed that they all are customizable except for the Leave Balance Report for some reason. As you mentioned, this could be something to discuss with the developers to find out if it is a possibility, however, I suspect that it is considering they were able to put this functionality in for the other reports.

Hi Roman,

Once again, thanks for taking the time to address this. We really do appreciate your input/effort in trying to get the system up and running as soon as possible.


  1.  Indeed, we will confirm the change in accrual logic on Monday, 3rd October. Once we are satisfied that leave is accruing in the correct manner, we can start afresh and load leave due balances as of the end of October 2022 for a test group of maybe 4 people. They can submit all leave on the app for the rest of October and we can reconcile to our payroll at the end of the period  to see if everything is in order. If it works the way we expect it to, we can make the system live for the remainder of the staff effective November 2022.
  2.  With regards to the Leave Summary Report, even though this report is customizable, I still found that it gives me the total of the actual leave days submitted on the system by an employee for a specific period.

","Hi Chris,     Welcome to OfficeAmp!     OfficeAmp is office management software that works inside Slack. It's is a separate entity and can't be clubbed with Slack plan.    Cheers  Thea      ",10/4/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Feedback:
1. When going from the free version to the paid version it seems to have created multiple instances, or tied in another team. There should be a little more guidance or direction here.

2. My paid year is now completed, and instead of giving me a heads up or a notification the system just stopped working.

3. Now when i login to maybe reactivate the subscription it seems that all my employees information and vacation logs are gone.

Teams should advise you that your subscription is up


	
	

","Hi Emilio,     You have created a master team wherein you have merged 2 teams and currently you have 5 users in your team. Ideally you should be able to use the app as your team size is below 5 andI can see that your dashboard is also opening correctly from our end. Are you still unable to login to your dashboard?  ​   Also, can you tell me the name of the account wherein you were logging punches that we now missing? I will get it checked from our engineering team   Cheers  Thea      ",10/4/2022
AttendanceBot,Slack,"Basically too expensive for what we're using it for. All we were using it
for was to have agents punch in/out, take breaks/lunch in slack, then just
running a report to compare what was invoiced for hours by our BPO and what
we had recorded.

Hi Chris,

I noticed you uninstalled AttendanceBot. I would love to understand where we
failed and would really appreciate it if you can spare 10 mins for a quick
feedback call. Do you have some time this week or next?

Best,

Sorry for the delayed response. I was out due to a public holiday. I had a
discussion with my team about this and the report customizations are at the
present moment not a part of our future roadmap. I could talk to my
engineering team about making customizations specific to your account but
that would invite a fee as it would involve developer work on our end. Let
me know if that sounds good to you?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi AttendanceBot Support,     I'm about to recommend that all our staff begin using the ""cal"" command to link our AttendanceBot to our Outlook Calendars. This will have a significant benefit for us. However, when I link the Outlook calendar it mentions that it will set the out of office auto-reply as well and it does not appear to be doing so.     The good news is that this is perfect and I don't want it to, but I'm not sure if that is the case just for me or if others will have their out of office auto-replies set and I should include some way to enable or disable this function.     My question: Is there a way to enable and disable the out of office auto-reply functionality in AttendanceBot's Outlook integration?     Thank you!     Jeremy Higgins   CRC Endpoint Services   Stanford | University IT   650.725.HELP(4357)   Request Support: http://services.stanford.edu","Hi Jeremy,     We were discussing your case and our engineering informed us that auto reply in case of personal calendar integration gets trigged by the employee. So, once an employee integrates personal calendar, he/she will get an additional button everytime a leaves gets approved “Set Auto reply”. Once its clicked and a reply is added, it's synced to outlook calendar.   So, there is no way to disable that button as of now but its user triggered operation, so they can avoid using the button altogether.    Cheers  Thea      ",10/6/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"I'm running into some issues with AttendanceBot. 

The first one is: I'm trying to add a new person from last. I do the resync but the person doesn't show up. I get the notification that the sync happened but in AttendanceBot the last synced doesn't update.

The second thing is: I have set our account to do both Vacation and Time Tracking multiple times but it keeps defaulting back to just Vacation tracking.


	
	

","Hi Tivo,     Please share the name of your colleague who isn't present in the personnel page and I'll get it checked :)   Talking about your second question, I can see that currently, your feature set is marked for both - time tracking and vacation management. Can you tell me when did you run into the app defaulting the feature set to vacation management?    Cheers  Thea      ",10/7/2022

Thanks so much!

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"This is our first month on the system and we have found errors in both the Leave Report and Leave Summary Report.     Issue #1  Leave Report was run for ""last month"".  You can see in the header and file title it shows 01 Sep to 30 Sep. However, the report includes records from Aug 29, 30, 31.     Issue #2  Leave Summary Report has many totals that are incorrect.  We checked them against the detailed report (excluding Aug rows) and the calendar.  Examples:   - Chris Turcotte Working from home. 23 on Summary Report. Correct is 12 as per Leave Report  - Amar Acharya Working from home. 22.5 on Summary Report. Correct is 17.5 as per Leave Report  - Scott
      Loader Working from home. 17 on Summary Report. On the Leave Report, it shows 17
      days, but 3 of them were in August.  - Janice FIndlay. Both Working from Home and Working from Office are 1 more on Summary Report than Leave Report  (we did not inspect EVERY user, this is just a spot-check so there might be more errors).     Note that the totals on the Summary report are ALSO impacted by our previously reported Half Day issues (case 17428 and 17170) but that the issues above exceed those as many of them are users who have all Full days.     Please advise when the reporting will be fixed.","Hi Andrew,     The previous case were closed by the support team as Pranav is already handling the case. Pranav has already escalated your concern to our engineering team and they are investigating it.      I completely understand how frustrating it can be but I just want to let you know that your issue is important to us and Pranav will get back to you with the resolution as soon as possible.

","Hi Peris,     Of course! We typically recommend routing to managers before HR, but either way, from Vacation Management > Approval settings, you can set multiple levels of approval and/or fyi, each level going to a manager or individuals (e.g. an HR coordinator) before moving to the next step.

","Hi Cindy,     You can upload bulk data of your team using settings panel.   Please open the settings panel by typing ""Settings"" as a direct message to AttendanceBot and click on the URL prompted. Once you open the dashboard, please head to people --> Import team data. Click on ""Download excel file"", add the data and upload the file.     Also, I can see that your trial has expired. Looking at your current features in user, ""Pro"" is the right plan as you have set up leave quotes to your employees. You can subscribed by clicking on view plans and clicking on ""Subscribe"" button just before the plans.      Please let me know if you need any additional help, I am just an email away!

","Hi Sarah,     Happy to help. When configuring your PTO leave type from your dashboard, on the accrual tab you'll see a toggle near the bottom that says ""Enable Pro Rata"" -- assuming you accrue by calendar year, turning this on means that employees who join mid-year will only get a pro rated amount of PTO (ie not the full amount).      Regarding your other ticket, if you have an employee that leaves and rejoins, I'd advise you re-set their join date to the more recent hire data so pro-rata works automatically. If you then want to add additional balance for any PTO they still had before they left, you can go to their personnel file and directly add/subtract balance from Quotas & Balance > PTO > Adjustments.     Let me know if you still have questions!            ",10/18/2022

","Hi Sarah,     Let's say annual leave count is 12 and accrual period is monthly, AttendanceBot will pro-rate leaves if employee has not joined at the start of the year and he will be allotted his PTO days accordingly.

Is there a way I can change this in settings or is it a glitch of some sort? As far as I know nothing was changed with our settings and I cannot see anything wrong with our set up.

It looks like you installed AttendanceBot in your MS Teams workspace earlier this year, but the welcome and instructional emails we sent never got through and you didn’t get a chance to experiment much with the product.

While the opportunity may have passed, I did want to share our apologies for any onboarding frustration and offer one on one assistance if you’re open to giving AttendanceBot another shot - the software is really quite good.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Team,

We have an employee named Piyush Khairnar, who is unable to apply leave for 31st October 2022 through AB.

While he is trying to apply, AttendanceBot is giving him an error message as "" You are trying to apply leaves for days which are all holidays/weekend. Please change your dates and try again.""

We did check for our Holiday Calendar and confirm that there is no holiday on 31st October, and it also is not a weekend.

Could you please check at your end and confirm of the problem and ways to rectify it?

Hi Jeremy!

Sorry about that - can you uninstall the previous delete_leave zap and create a new one?

We had created a trial delete_zap before releasing our fully fleshed-out version, and it looks like you may have installed the zap while we were still testing.

Let me know how it works, and I'll plan to share a little more guidance tomorrow :)

Hi AttendanceBot... I saw that you had added a New Deleted Leave trigger in Zapier and am so happy! I've been eagerly anticipating this trigger and will help us out quite a bit... especially when unique IDs are added to both New and Deleted leave triggers.

My issue is that when triggering, it is throwing up an unexplained error. (Screenshot). I'm wondering if I may just be trying to use it too soon and it isn't ready or if this is an actual error. Thoughts?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Sarah,

Sorry for the delay in responding - I'm currently scoping out the
feasibility of implementing Frontdesk in our office as we share it with
others.

For context, the building we're in is owned by one company that occupies
the majority of the floors and the reception is staffed by them. The
receptionist, Bebe, is lovely and very helpful but doesn't have our details
etc. to contact the relevant people in the organisation when someone
arrives.

The idea is that we'd be able to have an iPad attached to the reception
desk that Bebe can direct visitors to fill out their details in and the
correct employee would be notified of their arrival.

I really like the simple nature of Frontdesk and think it could work well
but just wanted to clarify how it would work if we pop an iPad down in
reception? Would we just be able to have the rego page open in a browser on
the iPad? I just noted that there doesn't seem to be a unique identifier in
the URL bar to customize to Stake?

As the person who installed Frontdesk, will I be notified everytime
someone arrives? (I'd prefer not to be).

Also is it possible to add some of our own branding to the registration
page? As we share the building with a few companies it would be great o
make it clear that this is just for Stake by adding our logo prominently on
it

I'm still confirming with building management that we're able to have an
ipad in reception and access to the wifi down there but I'm hopeful that it
will work out.

Thanks,
G

p.s. as I'm based in Sydney, Australia none of the times in your calendar
really work well for me but I could possibly do a later night if it's
easier to talk through the above

I don't understand the connection here. India employees are not able to apply for a holiday. How does it matter if there are 2 offices in Germany. Anyone outside of Germany should be able to apply for a leave on 31st Oct unless its specified. Do you mean that you don't know which employees are from Germany ?

Hi Thea,

We do not have a company wide holiday as Reformation Day on 31st October 2022 for any other region and employees except for Germany - Hamburg.

Can you please help me understand which Holiday Calendar has Piyush Khairnar been added under ?

","Hi Pranav,     We were looking for a clarity on the holiday calendars so that we could tag the right calendar to the office and make the changes accordingly. There have been cases wherein Indian employees have been tagged to other region calendars.    ​   Talking about the reformation holiday, we just wanted a confirmation if this applies to all the employees in Germany. If it's for a specific one, we add the holidays to the correct region to avoid any further confusion to all the offices.     Cheers  Thea      ",10/28/2022

Thanks, Jordan.

We checked for application updates (Teams), PC updates, restarted Jerry's device, and still seeing the same messages.

Also, there is no way to access the dashboard without the links coming directly from Attendance Bot. Is there another login or work around to access the dashboard? Asking because I think the message is relating a mismatch with his punches however, we cannot gain access to the dashboard to review his timecard.

Jerry called this morning because he is seeing this message come back from Attendance Bot every time he sends a command (In, Out, Edit Punches). Are you by chance aware of any issues with Attendance Bot or know what might be causing this for Jerry? I am not having any issues and have no other reports.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi, Thea

One manager (actually our CEO) is too busy to check approval requests of
AttendanceBot, and he missed urgent requests several times from employees,
such as Sick Leave and Working from home.

To prevent this, the HR manager wants to take care of giving permission for
Sick Leave and Working from home instead of him.
Can we do that in your system?
We want to keep the role of allowing members to take Paid Leave because it
is usually not as urgent as Sick Leave and working from home.

Best regards.

",Asked in CS Triage,11/2/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi team,

It appears that the process for generating a report on time off has changed. Rather than typing in “report” and choosing “time off” and entering the parameters, this instead has to be typed in as a command such as “leave report 10/1/22-10/31/22”. However, these leave reports are not including sick time. What command has to be entered for a report to include sick time taken?

Thank you in advance,

Subject: 4 quick tips to get more out of AttendanceBot


Hi Conor,

While you continue to explore possibilities with AttendanceBot, I thought you'd appreciate 4 quick tips to help hasten your discovery.
1.     Get some teammates involved - AttendanceBot is truly a team tool, so its magic takes root with scale. Chat ‘introduce’ to the bot to start building your pilot team.
2.     Browse command options - message 'cheat sheet' to bring up a list of common commands. As an admin, you can even tailor this document to your team!
3.     Customize your experience - Have you explored the settings panel yet? From reminders and permissions to custom leaves  and approval workflow to project and client tracking, you can customize pretty much everything. Just message ‘settings’ to get behind the scenes.
4.     Announcements - Add @attendancebot to a team to stay in the loop with who's clocked in, who's on break, who has upcoming time off, who has a birthday, or your own custom reminders.

There is - of course - plenty more to consider like permissions, smart reminders, and calendar or payroll integration, but these tips should be enough to warm up the engines.

As always, I'm here for any questions you have, or you can schedule a quick call<https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjY3ODQ3OTA1LCJuYmYiOjE2Njc4NDc5MDUsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiJxNjd6aHA0aGd0Mm1rYXIxMnNyeSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09dGlwcyZfX3M9ajV4OHpmcGp4ZW9mb3ZvYW9tOXMifQ.4Erf03T5QyG100Gb3GMP0opeO24bt7B0qOfPjmaZgIQ> to dive deeper on any of these topics.

Hi Karishma,

Sincere apologies that this has delayed ingestions - looking across various lists we've been provided we are not confident that our list of Client Ops designations (US/UK/IN) are up-to-date and accurate. As soon as you can provide a mapping of 1) employee & 2) location they're supporting, we will get everything squared away.

Thanks!

Hi Dakota,

Regarding point 11 - The backend team would know that we have a few employees who are based in India but support UK and US region.
We had shared the list of those employees earlier and they are already mapped to the India Holiday list - Client Ops 2020. I have also attached an instance where I have asked the team to map a few new hires to the Client Operations Holiday calendar as I had no access to do so myself. Please check and let me know if this clears your doubt.

Regarding Germany Holidays - Sorry I missed briefing you on that part. So that is made for a few of German contractors who are placed in different regions, referred internally. For now we have Full time employees(added in AB) placed only in Munich. You can currently add only Munich Holidays under German Holiday Calendar. Below is the list of Holidays, highlighted that you can put under Germany location (I will let you know if you need to create new locations like Hamburg/Berlin in case we have any Full timer joining in those regions in future) :

Hi Karishma,

Sorry for the email bombardment, but adding a question and consolidating previous asks into this one email:

  1.  Regards bullet 11 ""India Client Operations Team"" --> can you clarify what you're looking to do?

     *   Confirmation: I believe the basics are that for Deparment=Client Operations in India, you'd like a separate holiday calendar applied.
     *   Clarification: How exactly is the US & UK list supposed to be applied? Aren't we talking about India employees only?

  1.  Regards holidays for Germany

     *   Clarification: how are region-specific holidays to be applied? It looks like there's just one office assignment for Germany, so I'm not sure how the Berlin/Munich/Hamburg distinction is to be made.
Thanks,
Dakota

","Hi Valentina,     Hope you had a great weekend.      I have checked your teammate Alberto's timezone in the app and it's set to Europe/Amsterdam.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hello,
I was talking to Dakota about a new PTO policy we want to implement next
year with hourly accrual, but since he's OOO, I thought I could ask you
quickly.

I had asked him this: ""*We have a couple of people who already requested
2-3 days off in January, and they won't have accrued those days by the time
they need the time off - so can we override the system somehow in these
cases?""*

And he responded: ""

*Yes! Two options:- Cleanest: you enable negative balances for PTO, say
with a limit of 3 negative days.- Most specific: you can also set an
individual-level PTO policy giving ONLY these employees the option to have
a negative balance. Only risk here is once the individual policy is create,
it is henceforth ""untethered"" to the broader team PTO, so if you even make
change to PTO policy you'll need to remember to either A) delete the
individual-level policy, or B) make the same changes to the individual
policy.*""

So my question is re: the first option -- would that be 3 full days for
each person based on their actual shift length, rather than say 24 hours
(based on 8 hour shifts)?

Thanks!

","Hi Carol,     3 days will be assumed to be 8 hours as the work hours are defined in AttendanceBot and not 24 hours :)    Cheers  Thea      ",11/14/2022

","Hi Arunkumar,     In Annual plan, the credits are allocated at the start of the subscription. Incase your employees leave, you need to deactivate the profiles of these users and then these credits gets adjusted automatically in case of removing users from your team.      In your case, when you remove existing employees, the credits allocated to you are utilised against the new total users in your team and your subscription gets extended automatically and you can continue to use AttendanceBot post the completion of your 1 year contract from your initial payment date.    Cheers  Thea      ",11/17/2022

Hi Team,

PubMatic employees since today morning have been getting the check-in notification on their AttendanceBot application.
Attached is the error message for your reference.

Could you please help us understand if there was any settings change or update that has been done from the backend. And also how can this be rectified ?

Hello Pranav,

I hope you’re doing well.

My colleague @Ahmed Rizk<mailto:Ahmed.Rizk@pixelogicmedia.com> is working on analyzing AttendanceBot data for performance and capacity management and he is seeing discrepancy between the data available the AttendanceBot dashboard and the export from the system.

He will provide specific examples that your team can look into and resolve for us.

This is high priority for us so we really appreciate your collaboration to get this resolved as soon as possible.

Hey Gal,

Hope your week is shaping up well!

I always love to see clients succeed and clearly you’re doing something
right. In fact, looks like your subscription has been unable to keep up.

Attached you’ll find a month-by-month breakdown of your users measured
again initial subscription of 32 users, and now has grown to 47 users -
please let me know if monthly users don’t line up with your experience.

I do apologize if this comes as a surprise but since your annual renewal is
coming up on 23th Nov it seems like as good a time as any to reconcile the
books.

In the meantime, we’re happy to chat about how we can better support you,
so if you have any questions about this reconciliation, your upcoming
renewal, feedback about your experience, additional support needs, or
really anything at all you’d like to talk about, let me know and I’ll share
a calendly link!

AttendanceBot for the past few weeks has been giving errors and is not working in all the channels that we have synced it with. The specific channel displays leave and remote working schedule for a specific set of employees. It is expected that the app is supposed to work without any issue in all the channels that have been synced with it.

At present all channels can get the notifications for PubMatic employees across. It is required that the notifications are more group and channel specific.

In the added screenshot above, the number of members of that channel is 23 but around 46 notifications are sent to the channel for even the other employees who are not a part of that channel.
Hence, request you to fix this as soon as possible.

Let me know in case of any questions.

","Hi Hasan,     We can surely work around the pricing for you. Can you share how many employees will be using the app?    Cheers  Thea      ",11/30/2022
AttendanceBot,Slack,"Hi Sarah,

Thank you for this! I actually signed us up for the free trial and then was
out of the office unexpectedly a lot the past few weeks. Just getting back
to this. Is there any chance we can do another free trial or get an
extension?

I'm looking for an app that integrates with Slack and allows me to input
our employee schedule, manage time off requests, approve or deny shift
swaps and easily track and manage on time clock corrections. We are a small
animal hospital with 19 team members. Any suggestions, advice or feedback
you can provide would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,

Jennifer

","Hi Jennifer,     Of course! I've reset your trial until Dec 16. As far as tips, especially since you'll be using our more robust shift scheduling functionality I highly recommending​ booking time with our sales team to talk through your needs and policies - they'll help you get set up so you don't have to figure everything out from the get go.

Thanks for the quick response.

So, if they don’t have it showing like in the image below, it is not activated right? How can I see a list of this in the AttendaceBot web app?

Is there a way to send the Grant Permission question again? Or is Slack in charge of that?

AttendanceBot,Slack,"Good afternoon!

I just re-subscribed to your service (invoice and receipt attached 
hereto), but when I try to login I am getting the following message.

""Seems like you are logged in with a team which does not have 
AttendanceBot installed in it. Logout and login into another team.""

The login I am using is scheduler@regalcourtreporting.com in the Regal 
Court Reporting team.

I am also getting the same message when clicking the Settings Dashboard 
link from the bot in Slack.

I'm not sure if some time is needed for the subscription to activate, 
but it seems like it's logging 'In' and 'Out' requests.

If you could just let me know if we need to wait a bit, or if there is 
something we need to do, that'd be great.

Thank you so much!

Good day!

Thanks,

","Hi Chanel,

Looping in Saurabh as a good POC going forward.

Regards leave balances, we typically keep the bulk upload page hidden to
avoid mistakes. That said, a few options you have:

   - Our preference is that you share bulk changes with us and we can
   ingest from our end
   - Alternatively, we *can* expose the bulk-upload to admin users if
   you're comfortable with that, but do note we can't take responsibility for
   mistaken edits. We will of course help resolve these mistakes but fair
   warning.
   - If it's just a few users you want to edit, it's easiest to do so
   manually for each employee. Happy to send a video showing you how!

Let us know how you'd like to proceed,

Dakota <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakota-lafee/>

","Hi Scott,     ​Of course.   Yes, the total overage is $210, though just to give you a little breathing room in case some were accidental actives, we'll be lowering the invoice to $190.  Renewal happens on January 1st, at which point you'll automatically renew to an annual subscription for you current user base (looks like 16 at the moment) and the process starts again. If that's not what you want to do, let us know now and we'll make any necessary adjustments.   Thanks,  Sarah         ",12/13/2022

  1.  Change status to lunch in Slack
  2.  Attendancebot used to immediately notice this and punch out
  3.  However during November/December 2022 the delay has started to be very long 15-30min, even more and this causes the whole lunch being unnoticed in Attendancebot as it never punches the user out because he/she finishes lunch before punchout even happens!

Hi JJ,

I'm Sarah, head of customer success at Harmonize. We're thrilled you're
giving AttendanceBot a try on Slack!

As you get started you're welcome to let AttendanceBot guide you through
first steps, but I like to check in because we do find most clients prefer
to schedule a quick walk-through to accelerate their product discovery
process. Saves everyone a little time :)

That said, you're more than free to keep things digital and email me
questions directly, or access live chat through our site

","Hi Josiah,     Fair enough! The team is happy to make time for you if you ever want to talk about upgrading to AttendanceBot and what additional options we provide, but if you're in a good place already that's great to hear.  ​  Cheers,  Sarah         ",12/14/2022
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hello! I spoke with your team a week ago about switching to the next 2 months with AttendanceBot on a monthly plan, due to us switching payroll providers in January.

It looks like we were still charged for a full year after that, as well as a separate charge for 2 months.

I have attached the receipt for the year charge. Please refund this amount.

I have noticed that the price of our last 2 invoices has more than doubled.

The pricing structure seems to have changed completely, this without any form of prior notice.

As much as I like AttendanceBot, I cannot justify paying $6 per user per month, which is almost the same price as for Slack itself.

I'm kindly asking you to bring us back to the previous pricing ($19 flat fee + $1.5 per user), otherwise I will start looking for alternative solutions.

Best regards,

Subject: Barry O'Meara - error on attendancebot

Hey.

Just working out Barry's holidays owed in his final salary and I noticed the balance against him on attendancebot isn't what I'm getting per the attached.  When I went through it, it looks like his 5 days in April were never deducted.  See screenshot below - the balance doesn't reduce after the 5 days are approved.  So, essentially it's overstating his balance by the 5 days.  Worried it's doing this with others.  Could you take a look as we'll have to reconcile everyone's balances for 2022.  John has asked me to do rec's for everyone as he spotted a few things also.
Thanks

","Hi Yonat,     I see ""Auto Invite Users"" option is enabled for your team, so the new team members will receive an introductory message from AttendanceBot explaining how to use it. Otherwise to start with, you can cover the basics like how to punch for in/out/break/lunch, apply for leaves, delete leave requests, to view their timesheet and quota balances.   Hope this should be good to get started :)    Cheers  Rose",1/24/2023
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Is there a way to track tardy/late arrivals?  Early Departures?

The gusto integration, does it update the gusto timesheets or just reports to the next payroll the hours?


	
	

","Hi Timothy,     You can enable ""Highlight late arrivals"" option to get notified about late arrivals on in/out notifications, punchboard, timesheet, and the timesheet report. Head to Time tracking-> General time settings-> under Other settings-> Highlight late arrivals.     You can also generate timesheet summary to view the in/out durations to track early departures. Type in 'report' as dm to app, and app will prompt a couple of options- choose report type as timesheet summary, set rest according to your requirement and click on confirm to generate report.",1/25/2023
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"I would like to know if AttendanceBot can be used for supervisors to document attendance, rather than employees signing in/out on their own? We are running retail stores, our managers are on teams, but retail salespeople are not. We are looking for a system that is better than excel, to build weekly/monthly schedules and document attendances, hours, time off, vacations or AWP/AWOP.


	
	

","Hi Greg,     You can certainly build weekly/monthly shifts, track attendance through timesheets, manage time offs and leave quotas and much more through AttendanceBot. All this administrative actions require employees to punch in and out and the managers cannot do this on behalf of the employees.    Cheers  Rose",1/25/2023
AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Dear Finance Team,

We need to cancel our subscription effective immediately for AttendanceBot.  Please close the account effective immediately.

Can you kindly confirm?

It sounds like you found the keyword editor, which is located at the top when you open a leave type for editing.     If you've already removed keywords (like vacation) then my guess is that the name itself for inactivated leave types is causing the issue - leave type name is the primary keyword, so if you have a ""vacation"" leave type - even deactivated - you will no longer be able to use ""vacation"" elsewhere. I'd recommend deleting altogether OR just repurposing since you can rename and leave type.

there seems to be an issue with commands ""wfo/ho every Monday"", ""wfo/ho every Tuesday"" etc.

It applies to several employees as far as I know, me, Neda, Ben etc.

Would you please have a look at it?

Thanks a lot

We have recognized a very slow loading time in general, but sometime it is even worse.

It takes a lots of time to load stuff on the web app, and I would like to ask if it has something to do with browser, country or anything.

Is there a way on how to improve it?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Team,

We have an employee named Dhawal Tote (P0544), who is unable to apply casual leave for 1st Feb 2023, through AB.

While he is trying to apply, AttendanceBot is giving him an error message as "" You are trying to apply leaves for days which are all holidays/weekend. Please change your dates and try again."" (Screenshot attached)

We did check for our Holiday Calendar 2023 for India Client Operation team and confirm that there is no holiday on 1st Feb 2023, and it also is not a weekend.

Could you please check at your end and confirm of the problem and ways to rectify it?

Thanks & Regards,

I am interested in using this app. My manager is a team of 4 including herself.  Since she has no time to learn this app she has asked me to set it up for her.  Is there a video or documentation tutorial (walk through) on how to setup AttendanceBot as a Manager and also one for her direct reports.  I will be training my team and helping to set this up on the 10th of February.  Can we setup sometime to go through this or if you can email be documentation or links to videos so I can be prepared to train my team.

We will only use this for PTO and not for projects.

Subject: 4 quick tips to get more out of AttendanceBot


EXTERNAL - Use Caution. Do not click links or open attachments unless you know the content is safe.

Hi Harlan,

While you continue to explore possibilities with AttendanceBot, I thought you'd appreciate 4 quick tips to help hasten your discovery.
1.     Get some teammates involved - AttendanceBot is truly a team tool, so its magic takes root with scale. Chat ‘introduce’ to the bot to start building your pilot team.
2.     Browse command options - message 'cheat sheet' to bring up a list of common commands. As an admin, you can even tailor this document to your team!
3.     Customize your experience - Have you explored the settings panel yet? From reminders and permissions to custom leaves  and approval workflow to project and client tracking, you can customize pretty much everything. Just message ‘settings’ to get behind the scenes.
4.     Announcements - Add @attendancebot to a team to stay in the loop with who's clocked in, who's on break, who has upcoming time off, who has a birthday, or your own custom reminders.

There is - of course - plenty more to consider like permissions, smart reminders, and calendar or payroll integration, but these tips should be enough to warm up the engines.

As always, I'm here for any questions you have, or you can schedule a quick call<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJkZXRvdXIiLCJpc3MiOiJtb25vbGl0aCIsInN1YiI6ImRldG91cl9saW5rIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc1MDk5MTI4LCJuYmYiOjE2NzUwOTkxMjgsImFjY291bnRfaWQiOiI5NjIwNDQ3IiwiZGVsaXZlcnlfaWQiOiJmN3k1aG43bTkwaXAxOG54YXN2OCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZW5kbHkuY29tL2N1c3RvbWVyLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaGFybW9uaXplL2F0dGVuZGFuY2Vib3QtZGVtbz91dG1fc291cmNlPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09dGlwcyZfX3M9b2traTU5cjNoeDQwdXlneTh2MW4ifQ.o9C4UYbtoFYKeiUMndUq_5qHj9hv-4U4JKk-si3NhTk__;!!A14RNwfIftzD!RZX_nGBP16lNV-AO44HBWS4MRdJt3ofcMuO1nmjwZM1E0MQJNsQlF3iCwfy8hqSYmIKc3NhQUyKZvVdAXej_FZI$> to dive deeper on any of these topics.

I'm hoping for a miracle regarding our subscription...

I'm seeing that our yearly subscription renewed itself on January 1st. Unfortunately, our company has decided to use our HRIS platform to handle all of our time management needs, and is looking to end our AttendanceBot subscription as it has not been used since before the new-year. 

Is there anything that can be done?

","Hi Cynthia,     To change manager, type in ""change manager"" as a dm to the app. The app will ask you to select your manager from the employee dropdown. Once you select, your manager will be set and you can view the same by typing ""my manager"".       To apply for leave, type in ""apply"" as a dm to the app. Set the employee, leave type, leave duration and date from the dropdown when prompted and click on submit.     The leave request is notified to the employee's manager and the manger can either approve or deny the leave applied.      You may also get in touch with one of our product experts - they will walk you through the AttendanceBot settings and clarify on any questions you may have. Here's the link to schedule a time :)   Cheers  Rose         ",2/1/2023

When I punch in on Slack, it doesn't give me the option to choose which project, it just instantly chooses one for me. Is there a way to fix that?

","Hi Cash,     Glad the software's been working well so far! If you're open to our upfront annual plan, we're happy to let you continue with Pro access at Standard plan pricing (so $4/u/mo).

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"This is a follow up from ticket 17790. It appears to relate to the original issue (duplicate status), along with the limitation on ""breaking a status"" (which was initially implemented as a fix to the duplicate issue.   Over the past month, we have a handful of instances of duplicate status for the same user/time:     shiyun.lum@century21.ca - Feb 1 - user set full day wfh and then changed to half day sick (see attached screenshot of chat with bot)
  tbartram@uniglobe.com - Jan 11 -user set full day wfh and then changed to half day sick
  These 2 both appear to be issues with half day leave not being able to break/overwrite a full day status. Note that I have tested this and it is not specific to status type (wfo, wfh, sick). It is specific to half days breaking whole days.     We also had:  jerick.guevarra@century21.ca - Jan 27 - Status set by himself and another admin on the same day
  mlopes@charpac.ca - Jan 9 - wfo and wfh both set by same user (one retroactively)
     Please research these and apply the necessary updates so that duplicates do not occur.

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Evening,

*I understand the role my actions played in this issue; however, I need
your help to correct the issue.*  Additionally, I believe this issue points
out potential bugs in either or both of your systems.  Please give close
attention to the full description of the issue and the impact.

Gusto referred me to this email (support@gusto.com) to report an issue with
an integration with Attendancebot. I am including Attendancebot support in
case there is a way on your end to troubleshoot.

I am unable to match to the correct user in Gusto for Rebecca Victor
because, erroneously, a new user was created when what needed to happen was
she needed to be ""re-hired"" in Gusto's system.

After finding out the error, I requested that the user Rebecca Victor's
duplicate account be deleted from Gusto because if that is done, then the
integration will again work.

I am again requesting that Rebecca's duplicate account in Gusto be deleted.

*Please read carefully*

I run payroll on a weekly basis and the ease of using this integration is a
benefit to me. Attendancebot returns an error when I try to submit payroll
via the Attendancebot to Gusto integration, due to the mismatched account
(see screenshot).

Request to Gusto: Please remove the account that does not have banking
account information for Rebecca Victor so that I may proceed with the
integration.

Request to Attendancebot: Please reset the matching for user Rebecca
Victor, to see if I will be able to then rematch/remap to the correct user
(there currently are two users by the same name Rebecca Victor) in Gusto.
I am making the Attendancebot request because I am not sure that Gusto will
remove the erroneous account for Rebecca though I placed two calls making
this request and despite this email request following up with Gusto (at
their direction).

*There is an urgency to this request*

Also, there is some time pressure because I have a deadline of Monday at
7pm to run payroll to have employee direct deposits made by Friday morning
of the same week.

I will check for responses between now and Monday.  Please give this your
urgent attention.  Please give me a phone call at any time at 212
586-0899.

","Here's the screenshot from Attendancebot:

You will see that it is trying to match to both users (one is active and
the other is inactive) - Rebecca Victor.

Attendancebot directs me to do what is not advisable.
Gusto doesn't register this as an issue on their end.  They have not (so
far) offered me a viable long term solution.  They believe both accounts
should remain reflected in their system. I wish that they would remove the
incorrect account as it was created in one day and reported the next day as
incorrect.  No funds have flowed to that Gusto account.  There is no SSN
nor any banking information attached to that account.

I wish for both service providers, Attendancebot and Gusto to make my work
easier by addressing what seems to be a bug in both systems.  I need an
option to move forward with using this integration to make running payroll
a button push.

She took one 8-hour day off on January 13th, so her owed hours should be 8.35 (not 2.16).      I compared her accrued hours and timesheet and found some discrepancies. She worked 8h18m on January 4th, so she should have accrued 41 minutes that day, but it says she accrued only 21. Same thing on January 5th - she should have accrued 39 minutes that day but only accrued 21.      Can you please let me know what is going on ASAP?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi team,

My colleague is having the same issue again. He can't sign in and out. He
went on a long vacation. Please fix the issue.

Kindly note that I might look for another service if this issue persists.
If you can remove the mandatory check out then that would be great.
Normally in the evening, we don't really monitor our people as they always
work late. They just want to shut their laptops and call it a night. We are
very happy with how things were in the previous versions. Now, what if I go
on leave for 2 weeks? I will have to face the same issue? We don't use the
leave functions here as we have other means of doing it.

Kindly advise when this is going to be resolved. Thank you.

It seems that there is an issue with WFO commands.

We have people coming into the office to Vienna from Salzburg a few times a month.

They reschedule their 'wfo every monday', 'wfo every tuesday' etc to HO, and request WFO again, so that they can choose the right office.

However, it seems that it does not always work, or does choose the office itself.

In addition, it in the PunchBoard shows only at the office they are initially assigned.

Thank you for contacting Gusto, my name is Kevin, I'm the agent assigned to your case.

I know how important is for you to have the correct information in your integrated app in order to process payroll correctly, I'm happy to assist you.

Rebecca's profile can't be deleted from the system, however you can perform a dismissal process in the incorrect profile and then perform the rehire process in the correct profile, by doing this you the incorrect profile is not going to be in the list of active employees, so AttendanceBot should recognize her profile.

Please let me know if you still may need help with this matter, I'd be happy to assist you!

Subject: Integration issue between Attendancebot and Gusto for Rebecca Victor

Evening,

*I understand the role my actions played in this issue; however, I need your help to correct the issue.*  Additionally, I believe this issue points out potential bugs in either or both of your systems.  Please give close attention to the full description of the issue and the impact.
Gusto referred me to this email (support@gusto.com) to report an issue with an integration with Attendancebot. I am including Attendancebot support in case there is a way on your end to troubleshoot.
I am unable to match to the correct user in Gusto for Rebecca Victor because, erroneously, a new user was created when what needed to happen was she needed to be ""re-hired"" in Gusto's system.
After finding out the error, I requested that the user Rebecca Victor's duplicate account be deleted from Gusto because if that is done, then the integration will again work.
I am again requesting that Rebecca's duplicate account in Gusto be deleted.
*Please read carefully*
I run payroll on a weekly basis and the ease of using this integration is a benefit to me. Attendancebot returns an error when I try to submit payroll via the Attendancebot to Gusto integration, due to the mismatched account (see screenshot).
Request to Gusto: Please remove the account that does not have banking account information for Rebecca Victor so that I may proceed with the integration.
Request to Attendancebot: Please reset the matching for user Rebecca Victor, to see if I will be able to then rematch/remap to the correct user (there currently are two users by the same name Rebecca Victor) in Gusto.  I am making the Attendancebot request because I am not sure that Gusto will remove the erroneous account for Rebecca though I placed two calls making this request and despite this email request following up with Gusto (at their direction).

*There is an urgency to this request*
Also, there is some time pressure because I have a deadline of Monday at 7pm to run payroll to have employee direct deposits made by Friday morning of the same week.
I will check for responses between now and Monday.  Please give this your urgent attention.  Please give me a phone call at any time at 212 586-0899.

Here's the screenshot from Attendancebot:
You will see that it is trying to match to both users (one is active and the other is inactive) - Rebecca Victor.
Attendancebot directs me to do what is not advisable.
Gusto doesn't register this as an issue on their end.  They have not (so far) offered me a viable long term solution.  They believe both accounts should remain reflected in their system. I wish that they would remove the incorrect account as it was created in one day and reported the next day as incorrect.  No funds have flowed to that Gusto account.  There is no SSN nor any banking information attached to that account.
I wish for both service providers, Attendancebot and Gusto to make my work easier by addressing what seems to be a bug in both systems.  I need an option to move forward with using this integration to make running payroll a button push.

","Hello Nanci,

Sorry for the inconvenience with the AttendanceBot and the time it is taking to get resolved.

Since this is a 3rd party app, we don't have all the tolls to troubleshoot the issue, I am sending you the article with the steps to map your employees to AttendanceBot, if it is not working you will need to contact AttendanceBot support for further help, the AttendanceBot contact information is at the end of the article.

Integrate with AttendanceBot.


Sorry for the inconveniences this may cause. I hope you have a great rest of day!

Hi again Juan Luis,

How was your first week?

I see you have less than a week left on your trial, and while you've started tinkering with AttendanceBot you may be looking for more support - we're here to help! We can walk through the ropes of being an admin, assist in setting up your team, thinking through rollout, evaluating subscription options, or share best practices from our clients.

Thank for your email.  We have recently done some testing for a small group of 4 colleagues, which is very positive and we are considering to extend our testing for the whole team up to 11 to 13 colleagues, please advise whether it is possible to extend our trial until end of Feb, then we can start to commit our subscription with AttendanceBot.  Thanks.

My name is Shannon; I process payments for our group and this software. Nice to e-meet you ?

I've recently updated our account in the AttendanceBot portal with our credit card information to be processed on March 1st when our account renews. Please let me know if there is anything else you need to ensure we do not have a gap in service.

Lastly, would you please update our account profile to send the invoices to me instead of Jimmy Vales?

Thank you!

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hi Thea

Please can you email me the invoice for last year's subscription. We can see we haven't paid you since 2021 and your invoice much have got lost.

Also if you can invoice us for this coming year too perhaps we can pay them at the same time? In any case we need your 2023 invoice by mid March so that we can pay it by our financial year end.

Many thanks

","Hi Donna,     Can you tell me the name of the employee who is unable to punch and the message she is getting?     Also, we have rolled out a new feature wherein if you forget to punch out, next day when you punch in, AttendanceBot asks you to add the punch out time for previous day and only when you add the punch out time lets say 6 PM, you can clock the fresh punch in.

","Hi Wendy,     If the leave is pending approval, there's no way to directly approve as an admin. However if needed, you can use the following steps:   Delete @username_of_requester will display all leaves for the user including the requested leave -- delete this  Delegate @username_of_approver will allow you to set yourself as the temporary approver instead of that manager (just follow instructions)  ​Once you're the delegate, submit leave on behalf of the requester again (e.g. apply @username_of_requester)   You'll now receive the request -- approve it  Once complete, use delegate @username_of_approver again but reply with NA to reset delegation rights.

Even if the employees apply for working from home or remotely, they can still punch in to record their hours so if they are WFH and punch in, the punch card command will show up if they are in or out.    Cheers  Thea      ",2/15/2023

I’m finding the Mailroom is very slow. When I take a picture of an item, it doesn’t allow me to assign it to someone until 2 hours later and once I select notify, it doesn’t actually notify that person until several hours later. Is this how it is supposed to function?

Additionally, I see that it is a paid service but I don’t see anywhere that states what the service actually costs. Are you able to tell me the cost of Mailroom?

AttendanceBot,Unknown,"Hello,
We've not gotten this to be resolved yet with Attendancebot.  Therefore, I
am not able to use the automation that allows me to submit payroll with one
click.

It appears, that the mapping of Rebecca Victor needs to be re-set.  That
way I can manually re-map her account, if that is possible.  As it stands,
Attendancebot is retaining a mapping to an account that no longer exists in
Gusto's system.  Gusto believe it has resolved our issue on their end.

If after reviewing the information from Gusto and the screenshot below you
believe that the issue is not on your (Attendancebot's) end, meaning you
believe it is a user error (my misuse of your product), else on Gusto's
end, please make that abundantly clear.  I will then correct the mapping --
or follow up with Gusto.

Please know that there is no option for me to re-map.  I have waited for
this option but have not found it and no one from Attendancebot has replied
to our company's request that Attendancebot reset the mapping to allow me
to start from the beginning with Rebecca's account mapping.

At this time, I believe Gusto has resolved the issue on its end, but I am
not getting the attention on Attendancebot's end.

Please review the *entire* history of this matter before replying. You will
see emails from aaronf@tuffcity.com across the past 3 weeks.

","Hi Claire,   I'm unable to locate any signed contract, but I was able to find this agreement document. Since we don't typically sign specific contracts, but rather rely on our legally binding terms of service and written email agreements, I can't be sure if a contract was never signed or if my old colleague Pranav simply failed to save and store a signed document.   Do let me know your thoughts     Thea         ",2/28/2023
