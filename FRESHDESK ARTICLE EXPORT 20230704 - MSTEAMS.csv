Approval routing and multi-level approvals,"From Approval Settings on your dashboard, you can specify where approvals are routed, how many levels of approval you'd like, and whether each step of notification requires approval or simply fyi notice. These settings are particularly valuable for organizations with a central administrator OR large organizations that want additional approval controls.



Here's how to navigate the page:

Approvals versus Notifications
The Approvals flow governs all types of leave that require approval, while the Notifications flow governs types of leave that are auto-approved (require no approval).
However, note that within the approval flow, each additional level can be set as fyi-only, so you may use the approvals flow to configure multiple tiers of notifications rather than extending the approval process.
Levels
Levels must be turned ""on"" using the toggle to activate
Each level represents a contingent subsequent step, and only occurs once the prior level has been resolved. For approvals, this means that additional approvals are only sent after the prior approve has been complete, so no simultaneous approvals are possible.
Recipients
Manager: The default recipient is always ""manager"" and always refers to the prior level. Level 1 manager will always be the manager of the requesting users, and level 2 manager will be the manager of the level 1 approver, and so on up the hierarchy.
Custom: If you'd like a single specific users to be notified or approve, select the custom dropdown. This allows only one user per level, and is typically used to route approvals/fyis to a central admin or department lead, like HR, IT, or Finance.

Future balance deduction against payroll versus instant deduction,"By default, AttendanceBot allows you a complete flexibility to apply leave on a future date (be it few months or next year) and leave balance is deducted at time of accrual period rather than instantaneously. 



How you can think about this default setting is that rather than deducting leave immediately, AttendanceBot keeps track and deducts only when the relevant payroll cycle runs. Here are a couple examples:



- For yearly accrual: if you request a date next year, the balance will be deducted from the next year's leave balance. If it's August and you wish to apply for leave in Jan next year, it will be deducted once the leave balance is accrued for the new year and not from current year's leave balance.



- For monthly accrual: if you request a date next month, the balance will be deducted when accrual runs next month. If it's January and you request September leave, balance won't be deducted until 1st Sep when accrual runs.





NOTE:

If you wish to turn this setting off, please reach out to our customer support team by typing ""dialm"" and submitting a ticket or visiting our website to initiate a chat with us. If turned off, leave balance will be deducted instantly at that very moment of approval.",https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000131738

How does adding or removing users affect my billing?,"AttendanceBot gives you complete flexibility over adding or removing users from your existing plan at any time. Depending on whether you are on a monthly plan or an annual plan, the impact on your billing might differ.

Monthly Subscription


Adding New Users: Whenever you add new users to your team, you are charged for those users in your bill for the subsequent month. For example, if you have 20 active users in your team and add 10 additional users in your team at any time during the month, you will be charged for a total of 30 users in the bill for the subsequent month.

Removing Existing Users: Whenever you remove users from your team, your bill is adjusted by taking into account the updated number of active users in your team in the subsequent month. For example, if you are paying $100 for 20 users in your team and you deactivate 10 users during the month, you will be charged $50 for a total of 10 users in the bill for the subsequent month.

We keep a track of the users in your team and bill you only for the active users each month. Your monthly bill is based on the number of active users at the start of the month.

Annual Subscription

In case of an annual subscription, you are given credits for the amount you paid initially for the subscription. These credits gets adjusted automatically in case of adding or removing users from your team.

Adding New Users: When you add new users, the credits allocated to you are utilized against the new total users in your team and your subscription expires prior to the completion of your 1 year contract. In this case, we charge you before your next invoice due date for the active users in your team. Let's consider two cases as examples:

Case 1: 
1. You subscribe to AttendanceBot Annual plan on January 1st 2020 for 100 users.
2. You add another 100 users the same day which makes the total active users in your team to 200.
3. This change in the total active users would expire your annual contract in 6 months on July 1st 2020 as opposed to January 1st 2021.

Case 2:
1. You subscribe to AttendanceBot on January 1st 2020 for 100 users.
2. On July 1st 2020, you add another 100 users in your team.
3. This change in the total active users, after 6 months from the subscription date, would cut down the remaining months in your contract to half and your contract will expire in 9 months from the date of subscription.

Removing Existing Users: When you remove existing users, the credits allocated to you are utilised against the new total users in your team and your subscription gets extended automatically and you can continue to use AttendanceBot post the completion of your 1 year contract from your initial payment date. Let's take the following case as an example:

1. You subscribe to AttendanceBot on January 1st 2020 for 100 users.
2. After 6 months, that is on July 1st 2020, you remove 50 users from your team and the total active users in your team stands at 50.
3. The remaining term of your contract will get doubled from 6 months to 12 months that is your contract will expire on July 1st 2021 as opposed to January 1st 2021.

We keep a track of the active users in your team and automatically adjust your credits each month whenever a new user is added or an existing user is removed from your team.

You can check all these details about your subscription by visiting the Subscription page of your Settings Panel. To head over to the Subscription page, please type settings as a direct message to the bot and follow the link to your Settings Panel.


Once you are in your Settings Panel, click on the Settings-->Subscription option to open your Subscription page.

How does timesheet approvals work?,"Managers can now seamlessly review and approve timesheets (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) of their reportees. You can find the timesheet approval page in the Time Tracking section of the settings dashboard. 







To review timesheets for individual employees, click on the ""Expand"" button present on the employee tile and select the period for which you would like to review the punches. Expanding each period you'll find daily summaries, and choosing to ""Review"" each day will show individual employee punches, similar to the Edit Timesheet screen. These tiers allow you to quickly zoom in and out of timesheet ranges to review and investigate.







To approve timesheets just click on the ""Approve timesheet"" button for that specific pay period, which locks the timesheet from further editing. You'll have the option to bulk approve across employees or across multiple timesheets for a given employee by selecting ""Approve all selected"" 



Note: the ""timesheet tenure"" toggle near the top differentiates timesheets with separate approval cycles. If you have only one approval cycle (e.g. weekly) then you should only see the one option and can safely ignore. If you have multiple - e.g. employees across regions with weekly, biweekly, and monthly overtime calculation rules - then you'll need to toggle between these periods to view and approved relevant timesheets by cycle.





Finally, you can reference historical approved timesheets in the approval log, which is the second tab of the approval page. The approval log is identical in format, but is purely for view access.



Once the approval process is complete, csv reporting with identify approval data as well. 







Note: You can turn on automatic manager alerts for unapproved timesheets, but currently this setting must be enabled by our internal team. Feel free to request by emailing sarah@harmonizehq.com, chatting support, or contacting our team on any channel.

How to configure overtime and time off in lieu (TOIL) rules?,"AttendanceBot lets you define regular hours so you can track and pay time worked beyond ordinary hour thresholds. Each set of overtime rules can be configured separately by office or by individual.



For most teams, office-by-office configuration is best and allows you to set rules based on regional requirements (like for California employees). Office configuration happens directly in the overtime dashboard.

At the top left you'll choose which office you're configuring from the office dropdown - if no offices have been created, you'll have to set rules universally.
You may select between any or all of daily, daily double, consecutive daily, or weekly overtime thresholds. These define both how and when overtime is calculated.
For time off in lieu (TOIL) you may choose between daily or weekly calculation - daily double and consecutive daily will not apply.
TOIL and overtime cannot both be calculated simultaneously, so as soon as you activate TOIL: 1) a TOIL leave type will be created in leave type configuration with balances automatically accrued based on overtime hours, and 2) existing overtime rules will be turned off.
If your operations are based in the US, you may also select between state-by-state overtime presets from the top right present menu. 




If you have employees with individualized contracts, so your organization requires many different overtime thresholds OR different overtime periods (specifically biweekly and monthly), AttendanceBot offers a separate method for creating employee-specific rules: employee profiles. To set up:

Visit the custom field section of your personnel dashboard and browse the relevant fields for ""work hours"". You will want to ""activate"" any work hour periods you need, chosen between ""Daily Work Hours,"" ""Weekly Work Hours,"" ""Biweekly Work Hours,"" and ""Monthly Work Hours.""
Every employee profile will how have a field for each activated work hour period. While each employee may utilize their own unique work hour settings, you will have to choose only one period per employee. No one employee may have multiple periods active at the same time - AttendanceBot can only calculate individual overtime on a single daily, weekly, biweeekly, or monthly basis.
For each employee, you may now set threshold hours by going into their profile and inputting a numerical value into the appropriate work hour field. Alternatively, you may use the import/export page to quickly set thresholds in bulk.


Note: this method works for both overtime and TOIL, and will override any office-level settings you've configured. However, TOIL must be turned on from the main overtime dashboard for this method to generate TOIL instead of overtime. 







Whether universal, regional, or individual, configured overtime shows up in many places across AttendanceBot.

The timesheet dashboard and timesheet editor will show overtime totals by day and by period
All relevant spreadsheet reports will show overtime, including: the timesheet report, timesheet summary, payroll report, and payroll summary.
If you've inputted employee wages, then overtime wages will automatically be calculated in payroll reporting at 1.5x.

At 9am (on working days), AttendanceBot announces the day's vacations
At 4pm (on working days except Friday), AttendanceBot announces following day's vacations
On Friday at 4pm, AttendanceBot announces following week's vacations
P.S. The notification time and the nature of the notification can be customised according to the user's need. 







The channel notification will only mention the availability information of the person and not give away the exact vacation type or comments that the employee gave when applying for leave to protect everyone's privacy.
