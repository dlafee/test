How does timesheet approvals work?,"Managers can now seamlessly review and approve timesheets (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) of their reportees. You can find the timesheet approval page in the Time Tracking section of the settings dashboard. 







To review timesheets for individual employees, click on the ""Expand"" button present on the employee tile and select the period for which you would like to review the punches. Expanding each period you'll find daily summaries, and choosing to ""Review"" each day will show individual employee punches, similar to the Edit Timesheet screen. These tiers allow you to quickly zoom in and out of timesheet ranges to review and investigate.







To approve timesheets just click on the ""Approve timesheet"" button for that specific pay period, which locks the timesheet from further editing. You'll have the option to bulk approve across employees or across multiple timesheets for a given employee by selecting ""Approve all selected"" 



Note: the ""timesheet tenure"" toggle near the top differentiates timesheets with separate approval cycles. If you have only one approval cycle (e.g. weekly) then you should only see the one option and can safely ignore. If you have multiple - e.g. employees across regions with weekly, biweekly, and monthly overtime calculation rules - then you'll need to toggle between these periods to view and approved relevant timesheets by cycle.





Finally, you can reference historical approved timesheets in the approval log, which is the second tab of the approval page. The approval log is identical in format, but is purely for view access.



Once the approval process is complete, csv reporting with identify approval data as well. 







Note: You can turn on automatic manager alerts for unapproved timesheets, but currently this setting must be enabled by our internal team. Feel free to request by emailing sarah@harmonizehq.com, chatting support, or contacting our team on any channel.

How to configure overtime and time off in lieu (TOIL) rules?,"AttendanceBot lets you define regular hours so you can track and pay time worked beyond ordinary hour thresholds. Each set of overtime rules can be configured separately by office or by individual.



For most teams, office-by-office configuration is best and allows you to set rules based on regional requirements (like for California employees). Office configuration happens directly in the overtime dashboard.

At the top left you'll choose which office you're configuring from the office dropdown - if no offices have been created, you'll have to set rules universally.
You may select between any or all of daily, daily double, consecutive daily, or weekly overtime thresholds. These define both how and when overtime is calculated.
For time off in lieu (TOIL) you may choose between daily or weekly calculation - daily double and consecutive daily will not apply.
TOIL and overtime cannot both be calculated simultaneously, so as soon as you activate TOIL: 1) a TOIL leave type will be created in leave type configuration with balances automatically accrued based on overtime hours, and 2) existing overtime rules will be turned off.
If your operations are based in the US, you may also select between state-by-state overtime presets from the top right present menu. 




If you have employees with individualized contracts, so your organization requires many different overtime thresholds OR different overtime periods (specifically biweekly and monthly), AttendanceBot offers a separate method for creating employee-specific rules: employee profiles. To set up:

Visit the custom field section of your personnel dashboard and browse the relevant fields for ""work hours"". You will want to ""activate"" any work hour periods you need, chosen between ""Daily Work Hours,"" ""Weekly Work Hours,"" ""Biweekly Work Hours,"" and ""Monthly Work Hours.""
Every employee profile will how have a field for each activated work hour period. While each employee may utilize their own unique work hour settings, you will have to choose only one period per employee. No one employee may have multiple periods active at the same time - AttendanceBot can only calculate individual overtime on a single daily, weekly, biweeekly, or monthly basis.
For each employee, you may now set threshold hours by going into their profile and inputting a numerical value into the appropriate work hour field. Alternatively, you may use the import/export page to quickly set thresholds in bulk.


Note: this method works for both overtime and TOIL, and will override any office-level settings you've configured. However, TOIL must be turned on from the main overtime dashboard for this method to generate TOIL instead of overtime. 







Whether universal, regional, or individual, configured overtime shows up in many places across AttendanceBot.

The timesheet dashboard and timesheet editor will show overtime totals by day and by period
All relevant spreadsheet reports will show overtime, including: the timesheet report, timesheet summary, payroll report, and payroll summary.
If you've inputted employee wages, then overtime wages will automatically be calculated in payroll reporting at 1.5x.

Approval routing and multi-level approvals,"From Approval Settings on your dashboard, you can specify where approvals are routed, how many levels of approval you'd like, and whether each step of notification requires approval or simply fyi notice. These settings are particularly valuable for organizations with a central administrator OR large organizations that want additional approval controls.



Here's how to navigate the page:

Approvals versus Notifications
The Approvals flow governs all types of leave that require approval, while the Notifications flow governs types of leave that are auto-approved (require no approval).
However, note that within the approval flow, each additional level can be set as fyi-only, so you may use the approvals flow to configure multiple tiers of notifications rather than extending the approval process.
Levels
Levels must be turned ""on"" using the toggle to activate
Each level represents a contingent subsequent step, and only occurs once the prior level has been resolved. For approvals, this means that additional approvals are only sent after the prior approve has been complete, so no simultaneous approvals are possible.
Recipients
Manager: The default recipient is always ""manager"" and always refers to the prior level. Level 1 manager will always be the manager of the requesting users, and level 2 manager will be the manager of the level 1 approver, and so on up the hierarchy.
Custom: If you'd like a single specific users to be notified or approve, select the custom dropdown. This allows only one user per level, and is typically used to route approvals/fyis to a central admin or department lead, like HR, IT, or Finance.

Update Employees Data using Import Team Data,"AttendanceBot allows administrators to update employee profile information in bulk using the People>> Import Team Data section of the dashboard. This saves time and improves accuracy when first configuring your team.





Since ""Import Team Data"" serves a dual import/export purpose, you can download to export and view personnel data, then after editing/repopulating employees details on the spreadsheet you can upload file to update AttendanceBot in bulk. 



When first setting up your team, the most critical field to populate is manager email. Additional popular fields to complete are joining date, date of birth, department, and office, though infinite custom fields are possible once created from the personnel >> custom field menu.



Important note - Do not add any rows or columns to the excel file downloaded from the dashboard as you are unable to create new fields using export/import. For this you can use the custom fields menu mentioned above.

Future balance deduction against payroll versus instant deduction,"By default, AttendanceBot allows you a complete flexibility to apply leave on a future date (be it few months or next year) and leave balance is deducted at time of accrual period rather than instantaneously. 



How you can think about this default setting is that rather than deducting leave immediately, AttendanceBot keeps track and deducts only when the relevant payroll cycle runs. Here are a couple examples:



- For yearly accrual: if you request a date next year, the balance will be deducted from the next year's leave balance. If it's August and you wish to apply for leave in Jan next year, it will be deducted once the leave balance is accrued for the new year and not from current year's leave balance.



- For monthly accrual: if you request a date next month, the balance will be deducted when accrual runs next month. If it's January and you request September leave, balance won't be deducted until 1st Sep when accrual runs.





NOTE:

If you wish to turn this setting off, please reach out to our customer support team by typing ""dialm"" and submitting a ticket or visiting our website to initiate a chat with us. If turned off, leave balance will be deducted instantly at that very moment of approval.",https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000131738
How does adding or removing users affect my billing?,"AttendanceBot gives you complete flexibility over adding or removing users from your existing plan at any time. Depending on whether you are on a monthly plan or an annual plan, the impact on your billing might differ.

Monthly Subscription


Adding New Users: Whenever you add new users to your team, you are charged for those users in your bill for the subsequent month. For example, if you have 20 active users in your team and add 10 additional users in your team at any time during the month, you will be charged for a total of 30 users in the bill for the subsequent month.

Removing Existing Users: Whenever you remove users from your team, your bill is adjusted by taking into account the updated number of active users in your team in the subsequent month. For example, if you are paying $100 for 20 users in your team and you deactivate 10 users during the month, you will be charged $50 for a total of 10 users in the bill for the subsequent month.

We keep a track of the users in your team and bill you only for the active users each month. Your monthly bill is based on the number of active users at the start of the month.

Annual Subscription

In case of an annual subscription, you are given credits for the amount you paid initially for the subscription. These credits gets adjusted automatically in case of adding or removing users from your team.

Adding New Users: When you add new users, the credits allocated to you are utilized against the new total users in your team and your subscription expires prior to the completion of your 1 year contract. In this case, we charge you before your next invoice due date for the active users in your team. Let's consider two cases as examples:

Case 1: 
1. You subscribe to AttendanceBot Annual plan on January 1st 2020 for 100 users.
2. You add another 100 users the same day which makes the total active users in your team to 200.
3. This change in the total active users would expire your annual contract in 6 months on July 1st 2020 as opposed to January 1st 2021.

Case 2:
1. You subscribe to AttendanceBot on January 1st 2020 for 100 users.
2. On July 1st 2020, you add another 100 users in your team.
3. This change in the total active users, after 6 months from the subscription date, would cut down the remaining months in your contract to half and your contract will expire in 9 months from the date of subscription.

Removing Existing Users: When you remove existing users, the credits allocated to you are utilised against the new total users in your team and your subscription gets extended automatically and you can continue to use AttendanceBot post the completion of your 1 year contract from your initial payment date. Let's take the following case as an example:

1. You subscribe to AttendanceBot on January 1st 2020 for 100 users.
2. After 6 months, that is on July 1st 2020, you remove 50 users from your team and the total active users in your team stands at 50.
3. The remaining term of your contract will get doubled from 6 months to 12 months that is your contract will expire on July 1st 2021 as opposed to January 1st 2021.

We keep a track of the active users in your team and automatically adjust your credits each month whenever a new user is added or an existing user is removed from your team.

You can check all these details about your subscription by visiting the Subscription page of your Settings Panel. To head over to the Subscription page, please type settings as a direct message to the bot and follow the link to your Settings Panel.


Once you are in your Settings Panel, click on the Settings-->Subscription option to open your Subscription page.

Vacation
Sick
Traveling
Work from home
Working remotely


You can create new leaves or edit leaves depending on your company policy by clicking on this link and selecting ""Create new""









Also, here's an article explaining how your employees can apply for leave. 



Note:

If you want to assign leave quotas and accrual logic for your employees, please refer to the vacation quota set up.

How do I enable leave privacy to hide leave types?,"Leaves taken by your team are shown on team channel notifications, summary, and calendars. You have the flexibility to select which leave types to show and which to hide from public interfaces. For example, you might choose to show who is on ""vacation"" but hide who is ""sick"".



To hide a leave type, head to Vacation Management -> Leaves -> Leave Types and Quotas and select the leave type to hide by clicking on the ""Edit"" icon. 
Disable ""show leave type"" for the leave type.




Once disabled, the leave type will be hidden from all public interfaces (channel notifications, summary, and calendars). For example, if a team member now takes a ""sick leave"", channel notifications or the calendar will say, ""@user is on leave"" instead of ""@user is sick"". 
Note: Managers can still see the leave type will approved their employee's leave 

",https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000105285
How to setup leave quotas based on my company policy?,"You can refer to this video tutorial for understanding how to apply quotas: 




Below is the step wise process to set up accruals:



a) To setup leave accruals for your team in AttendanceBot, head to your Settings Panel by typing settings to the bot. Once you are in, navigate to VACATION MANAGEMENT-->Leaves-->Leave Types and Quotas page. By default, we have 8 different kinds of leave types, each with an unlimited balance and annual accrual interval. This means everyone can avail unlimited number of leaves for each leave type.



You can disable any leave type by clicking on the toggle button for status. To delete any leave type, you can click on the edit pencil and delete from within the configuration window.





b) You can also create any number of custom leave types. To do so, click ""Create New"", title the leave and assign synonyms associated with the leaves from the keywords section. Leave synonyms are the words which are associated with that particular leave and can be used while applying for a leave in AttendanceBot.

In the case of parental leave, you might include synonyms like maternity, paternal, or child care. In the case of ""Working from office"", keywords might include wfo, ito, hq, or even ""driving in"". Just mention all permutations of the word which you want to enable employees to use while requesting.



This is a good place to do some localisation in terms of language as well. If you are creating vacation types for non English speaking employees, you can add some synonyms in their local language. Set the basic rules for this new leave type.








c) If you need to set specific leave accruals for any leave type once again navigate to the edit window and select the second tab ""accrual settings.""



There are various settings that needs to be configured, with limited accruals requiring more configuration than unlimited.



Unlimited Leaves allotted 



Limited Leaves allotted





Meanings for each configuration are below: 



1. Allow hourly time offs : Users will be allowed to apply for leave by the hour; quick commands require start and end times like ""wfo 12pm to 3pm Thursday""



2. Enable half days : Users will be allowed to take half day leaves; quick commands require ""first half"" or ""second half"" with each request like ""sick second half today.:



3. Approval required : The leave will require approval from each employee's manager before confirmation in the system. If false, the leave type will be confirmed on request and send an FYI to managers.



4. Unlimited quotas : All users with access to this leave will have an unlimited balance. The following accrual settings apply only when quotas are ""limited"":



4.1 Accrual period : Interval during which the leave accruals happen. Annually mean all leave is accrued at the start of each year, whereas each subdivision divides the annual accrual into requisite number of periods and users only accrue that sub-total on the interval specified.



4.2 Annual leave count in days : Total number of leaves accrued annually. AttendanceBot will automatically calculate hourly & payroll accrual based on this annual number.



4.3 Cap on annual leave count : The maximum balance which users can accrue for this leave at any one time. One a user reaches this cap, all additional accrual will lapse and accrual will cease until after balance has dropped below this maximum.



4.4 Rollover in days : Number of days leave which rollover from one year to the next. If set at 0, all unused leaves are lost at the end of each year.



4.5 Allow negative balance : Allows users to request leave after they have exhausted their leave balance.



4.6 Max negative allowed in days : Grants the users specified days of leave they can use after they have exhausted their leave balance. ",https://attendancebot.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/17000051255

Hybrid Work Setup,"AttendanceBot allows you to configure workplace settings for a hybrid work model in which you may have desired days-in-office policies, office capacity constraints, or custom communications for your distributed team.



For each policy constraint, you'll be able to set rules universally, per office, or per department:





Office capacity limits are very straightforward, and prevent employees from booking WFO once the stated maximum limit has been reach (per planned WFO). Employees trying to schedule WFO past capacity will be notified that the office is full and directed to their manager for further instruction.





Alternatively, setting expected days-in-office allows administrators to create weekly minimum number of days employees should book in the office. Once set, this policy enables two optional reminders to help employees build good habits: one reminder sends direct notifications to employees when booked days-in-office fall short, the other reminder sends overview notifications to managers outlining booking status for their direct reports. Both reminders use configured workweek to automatically remind two days before EOW and the two days after start-of-week if scheduled WFO does not meet minimum goal.









Once configured, reminders will look like the following:

Seat capacity is set at the office level and availability is blocked when users apply for ""working from office"" leave in AttendanceBot. As long as your office has not hit capacity, you can use the apply command to book a WFO seat for yourself.













Admins have the additional options of viewing the seat calendar from the settings dashboard under Hybrid Work >> Seat Calendar.





If you face any issues using the seats command or the seat calendar, let us know by logging a ticket for us using the 'Dialm' command as a direct message in AttendanceBot & our support team will get back to you with a solution.

Using AttendanceBot, you can set up 4 levels of approval hierarchy. Head on to the Approval Settings on your settings dashboard.





Here, you can enable the levels and select the appropriate approving manager for each level. It could either be the manager of the previous level or a specific person from the team. This makes your approving process seamless and easy to manage. 



Workflow



Whenever an employee creates a leave request, the request would be passed on to the approving manager's AttendanceBot on slack like this:





Next the manager can either deny or accept the leave request. If he denies the request a message would be sent to the employee saying that the leave has been denied. 



In case the leave request is approved, it would either go to the next approving manager(if any set by the admin) or a message would go to the employee that the leave has been approved. 







The employee also has the option of giving additional details while applying for a leave as comments. The manager also has the option of adding remarks/comments while approving or denying the request.

This list will include both new teams and new channels to invite AttendanceBot to.



To enable and manage alerts, head to the Notification center of your dashboard; channel notifications will be the first page tab you see..

""Create New"" to see your notification options and select ‘Shift assignment alert’.






Select the channel to which you want to send out the notification - remember again that you must invite AttendanceBot to the channel before doing so.



Next, you will have three alert types that you can use to send out the notifications.
a. Self assignment alerts: whenever an employee assigns themselves a shift. To keep your team informed about the shifts being created.
b. Re-assignment alerts: whenever an employee reassigns a shift to another person.To keep the team informed whenever there are any changes done to the existing shifts. 
c. Shifts with Attributes: whenever a specific type of shift is assigned (for example overtime shifts or role-specific shifts).

How do I integrate Jira?,"By integrating AttendanceBot and Jira, you can record and monitor time spent on Jira projects and tasks from directly in Slack or Microsoft Teams. AttendanceBot will automatically identify when new projects or tasks are created in JIRA, and create corollary projects that relevant employees will see when they clock time to a project in Slack/Teams. 



To integrate your Jira account, please head to the integrations tab on the settings dashboard and select Jira. All you'll need to do is enter your API key and sub domain and we'll handle the rest!

(You can find your API key by opening your Jira account --> manage account --> security --> create and manage API tokens)







After integration is successful, you'll have a choice to link JIRA projects or tasks with AttendanceBot project or subproject levels to automatically create and assign projects/tasks to your employees. 



If a project/task is created in JIRA, it is captured by AttendanceBot and any relevant team member clocking time to projects will have the new project/task available to log time in Slack simply by being created in JIRA.



To record time, they'll simply type ""in"" as a DM to AttendanceBot and select the pre-populated project and tasklist they are working on. To switch projects/tasks, another simple ""in"" is all they need, and to punch out entirely just a quick ""out"". 





Note: If you can't find the JIRA tab on your AttendanceBot dashboard, write us a note and we're happy to activate!
